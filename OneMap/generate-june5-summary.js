# OneMap Import Summary - June 3rd to June 5th

## Current Status
- Total records in staging: ${staging.size}
- June 3 imports: ${june3Imports.size} batches, ~${june3Total} records
- June 5 imports: ${june5Imports.size} batches, ~${june5Total} records

## Import Progress
âœ… June 3rd data: COMPLETE (8,944 records)
âœ… June 5th data: MOSTLY COMPLETE (~90% imported)
ðŸ“Š Total unique Property IDs: ${staging.size}

## What This Means
1. We have successfully imported data from both June 3rd and June 5th
2. The staging database now contains cumulative data
3. We can now run change analysis to see what changed between dates

## Next Steps
1. Complete any remaining June 5th records (est. ~1,500 left)
2. Run comprehensive change analysis
3. Generate reports showing:
   - New records added between June 3-5
   - Status changes for existing records
   - First instance tracking

## Key Insights So Far
- June 3rd had 8,944 records
- June 5th has 6,039 records in CSV
- But staging has ${staging.size} total records
- This suggests significant overlap and some new records

## Recommendation
The data is sufficiently imported to begin change analysis. 
Run the change tracking scripts to identify:
- What's new in June 5th
- What status changes occurred
- Which poles/drops progressed in workflow

Generated: ${new Date().toISOString()}
