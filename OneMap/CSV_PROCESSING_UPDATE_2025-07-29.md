# CSV Processing Update - July 29, 2025

## üéâ Major Milestone: First Status Change Detected!

## üì∏ Photo Tracking Enhancement Added - July 31, 2025

### Enhanced Import Script Now Includes:
- **Per-pole photo tracking** - Which specific poles have photos (e.g., LAW.P.B167 has photo ID 1732480)
- **Missing photo identification** - Which poles are missing photos for quality assurance
- **Photo coverage metrics** - Track improvement trends over time
- **Critical alerts** - Flags completed installations without photo documentation

### New Primary Import Command:
```bash
cd scripts/firebase-import/
node bulk-import-with-photo-tracking.js "downloads/filename.csv"
```

This replaces the basic `bulk-import-with-history.js` and automatically generates:
1. Summary log (`reports/quality-log.csv`) - Track photo coverage trends
2. Detailed report (`reports/photo-details-YYYY-MM-DD.csv`) - Per-pole photo status
3. Critical report (`reports/critical-missing-photos-YYYY-MM-DD.csv`) - Urgent photo needs

### Current Photo Coverage Baseline (July Week 4):
- Overall: 26.3%
- Completed installations: 0.0% ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL
- In-progress: 44.8%

See `photos/PHOTO_QUALITY_TRACKING_MISSION.md` for full details.
