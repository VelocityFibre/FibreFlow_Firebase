# OneMap Payment Verification - Sharing Note

## For Colleague

This module analyzes agent payment claims for pole permissions using GPS-based verification.

### Quick Start
```bash
# Run the complete analysis
python3 extract_first_permissions_complete.py
python3 create_complete_agent_report.py  
python3 validate_payment_analysis.py

# Check reports in reports/ directory
```

### Key Files to Review
1. `PAYMENT_VERIFICATION_CONTEXT.md` - Business context
2. `reports/2025-07-10_complete_agent_followup.csv` - Main conflict report
3. `reports/VALIDATION_SUMMARY.md` - Data integrity verification

### Key Findings
- 998 poles (26.6%) have payment conflicts
- 873 poles have multiple different agents claiming payment
- All agents have contact numbers for verification calls

### Integration Notes
This can become a FibreFlow module:
- Real-time duplicate prevention
- Agent payment dashboard
- Integration with existing Projects/BOQ

### Data Validation
All analysis follows antiHall principles - every claim is backed by verifiable data from the source CSV.
