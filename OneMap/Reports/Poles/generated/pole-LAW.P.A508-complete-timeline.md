## Analysis

### Why June 2 Records Missing from Master CSV?

The June 2 records likely were filtered out during validation due to:
1. **CSV Corruption**: June 2 had severe corruption (71.6% invalid records)
2. **Field Shifting**: The consent form text caused column misalignment
3. **Validation Rules**: Records with GPS coordinates in address fields were rejected

### Status Progression Pattern

The normal workflow for this pole:
1. **Pole Permission**: Obtained on June 2 (2 properties approved)
2. **Home Sign Ups**: Started June 9 with first drop
3. **Additional Connections**: Second drop added July 3

### Data Quality Issues

1. **Agent Names**: Export shows email addresses (ftlawhh14@fibertime.com) in raw data but numeric IDs (7.8, 8.2) in processed data
2. **Property IDs**: Show as "undefined" in master CSV but exist in raw data (281749, 281784)
3. **Address Variations**: GPS coordinates sometimes embedded in address field

## Recommendations

1. **Reprocess June 2 Data**: Consider relaxing validation rules to capture early pole permissions
2. **Fix Agent Export**: Investigate why agent emails become numbers
3. **Property ID Mapping**: Ensure Property IDs are preserved during processing
4. **Historical Accuracy**: The validated master CSV misses the initial pole permission phase

## Connected Drops Summary

| Drop Number | First Seen | Status | Agent |
|-------------|------------|--------|-------|
| DR1739625 | 2025-06-09 | Home Sign Ups: Approved & Installation Scheduled | 7.8 |
| DR1739622 | 2025-07-03 | Home Sign Ups: Approved & Installation Scheduled | 8.2 |

## Conclusion

Pole LAW.P.A508 actually has a richer history than shown in the validated master CSV. The pole permission was approved on June 2, 2025, but these records were filtered out during validation due to the CSV corruption on that date. The pole then progressed to home sign-ups phase with two drops connected over the following month.
