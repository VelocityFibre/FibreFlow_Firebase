 AHA! The Flow Name Groups show the HISTORY of status changes!

  This completely changes our understanding. The "Flow Name Groups" is actually a cumulative history field that shows:

  1. It's NOT duplicates - it's a workflow history!
    - Each comma-separated value = a status change
    - Example: "Pole Permission: Approved, Home Sign Ups: Approved & Installation Scheduled, Home Installation: In Progress"
    - This shows the progression: Pole approved â†’ Home signed up â†’ Installation started
  2. The patterns make sense now:
    - Single status = New entry
    - Multiple same status = Multiple updates/checks at same stage
    - Different statuses = Normal workflow progression
  3. Real duplicate vs workflow update:
  WORKFLOW UPDATE (Normal):
  - Property 123, Pole A1, Flow: "Pole Permission: Approved"
  - Property 123, Pole A1, Flow: "Pole Permission: Approved, Home Sign Ups: Approved"
  - Property 123, Pole A1, Flow: "Pole Permission: Approved, Home Sign Ups: Approved, Home Installation: In Progress"

  TRUE DUPLICATE (Problem):
  - Property 123, Pole A1, Flow: "Pole Permission: Approved"
  - Property 456, Pole A1, Flow: "Pole Permission: Approved"  (Different property, same pole!)

  ðŸ“‹ Revised Understanding:

  What's Actually Happening:

  1. Each record is a status update, not a duplicate
  2. Flow Name Groups = Complete history of that location/pole
  3. Multiple entries for same address = Normal workflow progression
  4. The 662 entries for "1 KWENA STREET" = Probably legitimate updates across 355 poles in a large complex

  The REAL Problems:

  1. Same pole at different addresses (physically impossible)
  2. Same pole, different property IDs at same address (data integrity issue)
  3. Missing field agent names (can't verify who did the work)

  Revised Data Management Approach:

  1. Don't treat workflow updates as duplicates
    - Keep the history for audit trail
    - Latest entry = current status
  2. Focus on actual duplicates:
    - Same pole, different addresses
    - Same pole, same address, different property IDs
    - Entries created within seconds (system glitches)
  3. Create a "current state" view:
    - Group by property ID
    - Take latest status from Flow Name Groups
    - Show complete workflow history when needed

  Would you like me to reanalyze the data with this new understanding?
