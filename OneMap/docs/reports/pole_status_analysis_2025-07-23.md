- **5 poles with 13 drops each**: LAW.P.D766, LAW.P.C546, LAW.P.C130, LAW.P.A757, LAW.P.A013

#### At Capacity (12 drops)
- **5 poles**: LAW.P.E417, LAW.P.E016, LAW.P.C541, LAW.P.B261, LAW.P.A686

#### Near Capacity (10-11 drops)
- **11 drop poles**: 8 poles
- **10 drop poles**: 21 poles

### Status Breakdown
| Status | Count | Percentage |
|--------|-------|------------|
| Pole Permission: Approved | 5,136 | 49.6% |
| Home Sign Ups: Approved & Installation Scheduled | 4,297 | 41.5% |
| Home Installation: In Progress | 838 | 8.1% |
| Home Sign Ups: Declined | 39 | 0.4% |
| Pole Permission: Declined | 24 | 0.2% |
| Other statuses | 18 | 0.2% |

## Key Findings

### 1. Capacity Violations
- **6 poles exceed the 12-drop physical limit**, with one pole (LAW.P.A788) having 16 drops
- This represents a data integrity issue that needs immediate attention
- These over-capacity poles may indicate:
  - Data entry errors
  - Misunderstood pole numbering
  - Actual physical overloading requiring field verification

### 2. Capacity Utilization
- **94.1% of poles** are operating well below capacity (under 10 drops)
- Only **0.6%** of poles are at or near capacity (10-12 drops)
- The majority of poles (58.1%) have 1-2 drops, indicating significant available capacity

### 3. High Activity Poles
Top 5 busiest poles by drop count:
1. LAW.P.A788 - 16 drops
2. LAW.P.D766 - 13 drops
3. LAW.P.C546 - 13 drops
4. LAW.P.C130 - 13 drops
5. LAW.P.A757 - 13 drops

### 4. Installation Progress
- Nearly 50% of records show approved pole permissions
- 41.5% have scheduled installations
- 8.1% have installations in progress
- Very low decline rate (0.6% combined)

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions Required
1. **Investigate Over-Capacity Poles**: The 6 poles exceeding 12 drops need immediate field verification
2. **Data Validation**: Implement validation rules to prevent pole assignments exceeding 12 drops
3. **Capacity Planning**: With 94% of poles under-utilized, focus new installations on existing poles before adding new ones

### System Improvements
1. **Real-time Capacity Checking**: Before assigning a drop to a pole, check current capacity
2. **Alert System**: Notify field teams when poles reach 10 drops (83% capacity)
3. **Data Integrity Rules**: Enforce the 12-drop maximum in all data entry and import processes

## Conclusion

The pole infrastructure shows good overall capacity with most poles significantly under-utilized. However, the presence of over-capacity poles indicates a need for better data validation and capacity management processes. The high approval rate and active installation progress suggest healthy network expansion, but this must be balanced with proper capacity management to avoid physical infrastructure limitations.
