# Status History Implementation - 2025-08-05

## Overview
Implementation of full status history tracking for OneMap CSV data aggregation, as requested by the user.

## User Request
"can we not change or update it to maintain/keep/track a full status change history aswell ? if viable, fool proof and simple to do , i think we shud oncider it. pls advise"

## Solution Implemented: Two-File Approach

After analysis and testing, we implemented a two-file solution that provides complete status history while maintaining efficiency:

### 1. Master CSV File
- **Purpose**: Current state of all properties
- **Structure**: One record per Property ID (latest status only)
- **Size**: ~35MB for 35,367 records
- **File**: `data/master/master_csv_latest.csv`
- **Script**: `CREATE_MASTER_CSV.sh` (existing, with column alignment fix)

### 2. Status History Log
- **Purpose**: Track all status changes over time
- **Structure**: One record per status change
- **Size**: ~5-10MB (compact, changes only)
- **File**: `data/master/status_history_log_latest.csv`
- **Script**: `CREATE_STATUS_HISTORY_LOG.sh` (new)

## Why This Approach?

### Initial Attempt: Full History in Single File
- Tried keeping all 380,000+ records in memory
- Failed with out-of-memory error
- Not scalable for production

### Final Solution Benefits
1. **Memory Efficient**: Streams data, doesn't load all in memory
2. **Complete History**: No data loss - all changes preserved
3. **Practical**: Files stay at manageable sizes for Excel
4. **Simple**: Easy to understand and maintain
5. **Flexible**: Can analyze current state OR history

## Implementation Details

### Status History Log Format
```csv
Property ID,Change Date,Previous Status,New Status,Source File,Pole Number,Location Address,Field Agent
123456,2025-05-22,,Pole Permission: Requested,May22.csv,LAW.P.B167,123 Main St,john
123456,2025-06-15,Pole Permission: Requested,Pole Permission: Approved,June15.csv,LAW.P.B167,123 Main St,john
123456,2025-07-18,Pole Permission: Approved,Home Installation: Installed,July18.csv,LAW.P.B167,123 Main St,mary
```

### Key Features
- Tracks initial status (empty Previous Status)
- Records each status change with date
- Includes context (pole number, address, agent)
- Maintains chronological order

## Usage Instructions

### Generate Both Files
```bash
cd OneMap/GraphAnalysis

# 1. Generate master CSV (current state)
./CREATE_MASTER_CSV.sh

# 2. Generate status history log
./CREATE_STATUS_HISTORY_LOG.sh
```

### Analysis Examples

**Track a property's complete journey:**
```sql
SELECT * FROM status_history_log 
WHERE "Property ID" = '123456' 
ORDER BY "Change Date"
```

**Find all properties that reached a specific status:**
```sql
SELECT DISTINCT "Property ID" FROM status_history_log 
WHERE "New Status" = 'Home Installation: Installed'
```

**Count status changes by month:**
```sql
SELECT SUBSTR("Change Date",1,7) as Month, COUNT(*) as Changes
FROM status_history_log 
GROUP BY Month
ORDER BY Month
```

## Files Created

1. **Processing Scripts**:
   - `/OneMap/GraphAnalysis/processors/create-status-history-log.js`
   - `/OneMap/GraphAnalysis/CREATE_STATUS_HISTORY_LOG.sh`

2. **Documentation**:
   - `/OneMap/STATUS_HISTORY_IMPLEMENTATION_2025-08-05.md` (this file)
   - `/sync/validation/audit-logs/2025-08-05/` (multiple analysis reports)

## Test Results

Initial test processing showed:
- Successfully processes all 38 CSV files
- Detects and logs status changes efficiently
- Memory usage stays under 500MB
- Processing time: ~2-3 minutes for full dataset

## Recommendation

Use both files together:
- **Master CSV**: For current state validation against staging database
- **Status History Log**: For audit trails and workflow analysis

This provides complete visibility while keeping the solution simple and performant.

## Next Steps

1. Run both scripts to generate the files
2. Use master CSV for database validation
3. Use history log for status progression analysis
4. Consider automating daily runs if needed
