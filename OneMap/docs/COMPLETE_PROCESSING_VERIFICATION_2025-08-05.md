#### Files Processed ONLY in Status History Log:
- Lawley June Week 1 06062025.csv
- Lawley June Week 2 (all 5 files: 09-13)
- Lawley June Week 3 (all 6 files: 16-22)
- Mohadin June Week 4 24062025.csv
- Several July Week files

### Why the Difference?

The Master CSV script (`CREATE_MASTER_CSV.sh`) was looking in the parent downloads directory and found some files there with different names (like "june3.csv" instead of full names). It processed 27 files total.

The Status History Log script (`CREATE_STATUS_HISTORY_LOG.sh`) correctly processed the specific Lawley Raw Stats subdirectory and found all 38 files.

### Verification & Logging:

#### ✅ Verified:
1. **Record Counts**: Spot checks showed exact matches between source files and processed records
2. **Data Integrity**: Column alignment fixed and verified
3. **Status Tracking**: All status changes captured in history log
4. **Source References**: Each record correctly references its source file

#### ✅ Logged:
1. **Daily Processing Reports**: Generated for each file processed
2. **Master Summary**: Created at `data/master/master_summary_2025-08-05.md`
3. **Change Logs**: JSON files for each day's changes in `data/change-logs/`
4. **Status History**: Complete log at `status_history_log_latest.csv`

### Recommendations:

To ensure ALL 38 files are in the master CSV, you should re-run the master CSV creation with the correct directory:

```bash
cd /home/ldp/VF/Apps/FibreFlow/OneMap/GraphAnalysis
node processors/create-master-csv-with-changes-FIXED.js "../downloads/Lawley Raw Stats"
```

This will ensure both systems have processed the exact same 38 files.

### Current Status:
- **Status History Log**: ✅ COMPLETE (all 38 files)
- **Master CSV**: ⚠️ PARTIAL (27 files from mixed sources)
- **Data Quality**: ✅ VERIFIED (spot checks passed)
- **Logging**: ✅ COMPLETE (all activities logged)
