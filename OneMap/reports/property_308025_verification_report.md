# Data Verification Report: Property 308025
**Generated**: 2025-02-01  
**Purpose**: Verify database accuracy against source CSV files

## Summary of Findings

### ❌ CRITICAL DISCREPANCY FOUND

The database status history does NOT match the CSV source files for certain dates.

## Detailed Comparison

| Date | CSV Status | Database Shows | Match? |
|------|-----------|----------------|--------|
| June 13 | Home Sign Ups: Approved & Installation Scheduled | Home Sign Ups: Approved & Installation Scheduled | ✅ |
| June 27 | Home Installation: In Progress | Home Installation: In Progress | ✅ |
| **June 30** | **Home Installation: In Progress** | **Home Sign Ups: Approved & Installation Scheduled** | **❌** |
| **July 3** | **Home Installation: In Progress** | **Home Installation: In Progress** | **❌** |
| July 8 | Home Sign Ups: Approved & Installation Scheduled | Home Sign Ups: Approved & Installation Scheduled | ✅ |
| **July 14** | **Home Sign Ups: Approved & Installation Scheduled** | **Home Installation: In Progress** | **❌** |
| July 15 | Home Sign Ups: Approved & Installation Scheduled | Home Sign Ups: Approved & Installation Scheduled | ✅ |

## Analysis of Discrepancies

### Pattern Identified
The database appears to be showing status changes that don't exist in the CSV files:

1. **June 30**: CSV shows "In Progress" but DB shows it changed to "Scheduled"
2. **July 3**: CSV still shows "In Progress" but DB recorded a change to "In Progress" (unnecessary)
3. **July 14**: CSV shows "Scheduled" but DB shows it changed to "In Progress"

### Actual Status Progression (Based on CSV)
- June 13: Approved & Installation Scheduled ✅
- June 27: → Home Installation: In Progress (Real change) ✅
- June 30: Still In Progress (No change)
- July 3: Still In Progress (No change)
- July 8: → Approved & Installation Scheduled (Real change) ✅
- July 14: Still Scheduled (No change)
- July 15: Still Scheduled (No change)

### What Actually Happened
Based on CSV data, there were only **2 real status changes**:
1. June 27: Scheduled → In Progress
2. July 8: In Progress → Scheduled

The database incorrectly shows **7 status changes**.

## Conclusion

### System Data Validity: FAILED ❌

The status history tracking system appears to have a bug where it's:
1. Recording status changes when the status hasn't actually changed
2. Recording incorrect status values that don't match the source CSV
3. Creating phantom status changes

### Impact
- This affects data reliability for payment verification
- Status change counts are inflated (showing 7 instead of 2)
- Historical tracking is inaccurate

### Recommendation
The import script's status change detection logic needs to be reviewed and fixed. It should only record a change when the status actually differs from the previous import.
