## üîç Analysis

### What Actually Happened

1. **Data Cleanup Operation**: All 182 "Missing" status records had their status field cleared to empty/blank
   - No pole numbers were assigned
   - No field agent information added
   - No actual progress on these properties

2. **Minimal Field Activity**: 
   - Only 7 new properties added
   - 1 status change (Home Sign Ups: Declined decreased by 1)
   - No completions or new installations

3. **No Progress on Key Issues**:
   - The 182 properties that needed pole numbers still don't have them
   - No field work appears to have been done on these problematic records

## üìã Recommendations

1. **Investigate the Status Clearing**:
   - Why were 182 "Missing" statuses cleared to blank?
   - Was this intentional or a data export issue?
   - These records still need pole number assignment

2. **Field Team Follow-up**:
   - The 182 records still require field visits
   - No actual progress was made on resolving missing pole numbers
   - Consider re-flagging these as "Missing" or "Needs Field Work"

3. **Daily Tracking Improvements**:
   - Implement proper status values instead of blank/empty
   - Track reason for status changes
   - Add "Last Modified By" field to identify who makes changes

## üìä 4-Day Performance Metrics

- **New Properties Added**: 7 (1.75 per day average)
- **Properties Resolved**: 0 
- **Pole Assignments**: 0
- **Completions**: 0
- **Actual Field Work Progress**: Minimal to none

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Concerns

The clearing of "Missing" status to blank without adding any new data suggests either:
1. A data export/import issue
2. Intentional cleanup without resolution
3. Preparation for a different tracking system

These 182 properties still need field team attention to assign pole numbers.
