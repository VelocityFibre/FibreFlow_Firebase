   - Requires field verification
   - May affect payment processing

## Recommendations

1. **Immediate Actions**
   - Run duplicate pole analysis
   - Verify with field teams which properties actually have which poles
   - Update missing field agent names

2. **Process Improvements**
   - Implement duplicate pole prevention
   - Require field agent assignment
   - Add GPS validation

3. **Next Import**
   - Continue with this process - it works well
   - Address data quality issues first
   - Consider automated daily imports

## Conclusion

The import and sync process is **working correctly and can be trusted**. All 1,292 records are now in production FibreFlow. The technical process is solid, but business validation of the data (especially duplicate poles and missing agents) is needed before processing payments.
