# Pole Status Analysis Methodology Report - July 21, 2025
**Report Date**: July 23, 2025

## Executive Summary

The analysis of the Lawley July Week 4 data reveals **significant data integrity issues** that explain the apparent "over-capacity" poles. The methodology findings show this is primarily a **data entry and processing problem**, not actual capacity violations.

## Key Findings

### 1. Drop Counting Methodology ✅ VALIDATED

**Question**: Is the "drops per pole" calculation based on counting unique drop numbers linked to the same pole?

**Answer**: **YES** - The analysis correctly counts unique drop numbers per pole. However, the original report was **incorrect**.

- **LAW.P.A788**: Originally reported as **16 drops** → Actually has **6 unique drops**
- **Over-capacity poles**: Originally reported as **6 poles with 13+ drops** → Analysis shows **0 poles exceed 12-drop capacity**

### 2. Drop Number Uniqueness ❌ MAJOR ISSUE

**Question**: Do any of the drops from over-capacity poles appear at other locations?

**Answer**: **YES** - There are **massive duplication issues** in the dataset:

- **306 drop numbers** appear with multiple poles
- **235 records** show "no drop allocated" across multiple poles
- Examples of problematic duplicates:
  - `DR1739676`: appears with 3 poles (LAW.P.A517, LAW.P.A518, LAW.P.A519)
  - `DR1743481`: appears with 3 poles (LAW.P.B220, LAW.P.B221, LAW.P.B223)
  - `DR1748463`: appears with 3 poles (LAW.P.C479, LAW.P.C480, LAW.P.C487)

### 3. Data Integrity Status ❌ CRITICAL VIOLATIONS

**Question**: Is this status dependent and unique?

**Answer**: **NO** - The data violates fundamental integrity rules:

#### Violation Types:
1. **Drop Number Duplication**: 306 cases where same drop serves multiple poles
2. **Missing Drop Assignments**: 235 "no drop allocated" entries  
3. **Status Inconsistency**: Same drop numbers appear across different statuses

#### Status Distribution:
- **Home Sign Ups: Approved & Installation Scheduled**: 4,297 records
- **Pole Permission: Approved**: 3,095 records
- **Home Installation: In Progress**: 803 records
- **Various declined/rescheduled statuses**: 77 records

## Root Cause Analysis

### Original Methodology Error
The initial analysis that reported LAW.P.A788 as having "16 drops" was **counting records, not unique drops**. The pole actually has:
- **16 total records** (multiple records per drop due to different statuses/stages)
- **6 unique drop numbers** (well within 12-drop capacity)

### Data Entry Issues
1. **Multiple Status Entries**: Same drop-pole combination appears multiple times for different workflow stages
2. **Incomplete Drop Assignment**: Many poles show "no drop allocated" 
3. **Cross-Pole Contamination**: Same drop numbers incorrectly assigned to multiple poles

## Implications for Data Integrity

### Current State: ❌ UNRELIABLE
- **306 duplicated drop numbers** make capacity analysis unreliable
- **Cannot trust pole-drop relationships** for planning/installation
- **Status tracking compromised** by duplicate entries

### Business Impact:
1. **Installation Planning**: Unreliable data affects field team assignments
2. **Capacity Management**: Cannot accurately determine pole capacity
3. **Customer Service**: Incorrect drop assignments affect service delivery
4. **Billing/Provisioning**: Wrong pole-customer mappings

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions Required:

1. **Data Cleanup Priority 1**: 
   - Resolve 306 duplicated drop numbers
   - Assign unique drop numbers to each pole-customer relationship
   - Update "no drop allocated" entries with proper assignments

2. **Process Improvement Priority 1**:
   - Implement drop number uniqueness validation
   - Add pole capacity constraints (max 12 drops per pole)
   - Create automated data integrity checks

3. **Reporting Correction Priority 1**:
   - Update analysis scripts to count unique drops, not total records
   - Add data quality indicators to all reports
   - Flag poles with integrity violations

### System Enhancements:

1. **Database Constraints**:
   - Unique constraint on drop numbers
   - Capacity validation before drop assignment
   - Status transition logging

2. **Data Validation Rules**:
   - Drop number format validation (DR + 7 digits)
   - Pole number format validation (LAW.P.XXXX)
   - Cross-reference validation between systems

## Conclusion

**The "over-capacity pole" issue is NOT a real capacity problem but a data quality crisis.** 

- **No poles actually exceed 12-drop capacity** when properly calculated
- **306 drop number duplications** represent the real problem requiring immediate attention
- **Current data is unreliable** for operational decision-making

**Priority**: Focus on data cleanup and integrity validation rather than capacity management.

## Technical Validation

**Analysis Method**: Python script analyzing 8,272 total records
**Validation Approach**: Unique drop counting per pole with cross-reference checking
**Data Source**: `Lawley July Week 4 21072025_pole_records.csv`
**Analysis Date**: July 23, 2025
