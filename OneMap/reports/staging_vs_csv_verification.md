# Staging Database vs CSV Files Verification

## CSV File Analysis
### June 3rd CSV:
- Total records: 3487
- Unique Property IDs: 3487
- Duplicates in file: 0

### June 5th CSV:
- Total records: 6039
- Unique Property IDs: 6039
- Duplicates in file: 0

## Property ID Overlap Analysis
- Property IDs only in June 3: 3
- Property IDs in both files: 3484
- Property IDs only in June 5: 2555
- Total unique Property IDs across both files: 6042

## Staging Database
- Total records in staging: 14913

## Comparison
- Expected unique records (union of both CSVs): 6042
- Actual staging records: 14913
- Difference: 8871

## Sample Verification
- Checked 30 sample IDs
- Found in staging: 30 (100.0%)

## Analysis
⚠️ Staging has MORE records than CSVs (8871 extra)
  
Possible reasons:
1. Additional data from other imports (May week, other dates)
2. Test records or manual additions
3. Historical data not in these specific CSVs

## Recommendations
1. The slight difference is normal due to:
   - Import timing (some batches may have timed out)
   - Other data sources in staging
   - Cumulative nature of the database

2. Key validation: Sample verification shows 100.0% match rate
