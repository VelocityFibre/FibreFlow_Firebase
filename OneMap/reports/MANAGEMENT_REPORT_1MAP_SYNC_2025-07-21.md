## 2. Data Quality Assessment

### Overall Quality Score: 73/100 üü° (Needs Improvement)

#### Key Issues Identified

1. **Missing Pole Numbers**: 203 records (27%)
   - 182 marked as "Missing" status
   - 21 with other statuses but no pole assigned
   - **Impact**: Cannot proceed with installations

2. **Missing Field Agents**: 269 records (36%)
   - No agent assigned for pole permissions
   - **Impact**: Cannot verify payment claims

3. **Duplicate Poles**: 27 instances
   - Same pole number at multiple properties
   - **Impact**: Installation conflicts, payment disputes

4. **GPS Data Gaps**: 114 records without coordinates
   - **Impact**: Field teams cannot locate properties

## 3. Field Work Progress Analysis (May 22-26)

### 4-Day Activity Summary

#### ‚ùå No Meaningful Progress Detected

| Metric | Expected | Actual | Performance |
|--------|----------|---------|-------------|
| New Installations | 20-30 | 0 | 0% |
| Pole Assignments | 40-50 | 0 | 0% |
| Status Progressions | 50+ | 1 | 2% |
| Missing Status Resolved | 182 | 0 | 0% |

#### What Actually Happened

1. **Data Cleanup Only**: 
   - 182 "Missing" status records changed to blank/empty
   - No actual field work completed on these properties

2. **Minimal New Activity**:
   - 7 new properties added on May 26 at 15:15
   - All added within 3 seconds (bulk import)
   - No field data included

3. **One Status Change**:
   - Single "Home Sign Ups: Declined" changed
   - 1 property removed from tracking

## 4. Production Sync Results

### Successfully Synced to FibreFlow
- **Total Records**: 545 (73% of staging data)
- **Planned Poles**: 541
- **Active Installations**: 4

### Not Synced (Requires Action)
- **Missing Status Records**: 182
  - Exported to: `missing-status-2025-07-21.csv`
  - **Action Required**: Field team pole assignment
- **Other Issues**: 19 records
  - Duplicates and data conflicts

---

## 5. Critical Findings & Risks

### üö® High Priority Issues

1. **Zero Field Progress**
   - No poles assigned in 4 days
   - No installations completed
   - No missing statuses resolved
   - **Risk**: Project timeline impact

2. **Data Integrity Concerns**
   - Status fields being cleared without resolution
   - Duplicate pole assignments not addressed
   - **Risk**: Payment disputes, installation conflicts

3. **Field Team Performance**
   - 269 records without assigned agents
   - No apparent field activity May 22-26
   - **Risk**: Contractor accountability

---

## 6. Financial Impact

### Potential Payment Issues
- **Unverifiable Claims**: 269 records (no agent assigned)
- **Duplicate Pole Risk**: 27 poles (multiple payment claims)
- **Estimated Risk Exposure**: R135,000 - R270,000
  *(Based on R500-1000 per pole permission)*
