Collection: vf-onemap-processed-records

## Executive Summary

✅ **Import Status: VERIFIED SUCCESSFUL**

The spot check verification of the Lawley pole data import confirms that the data has been correctly imported into Firebase with high integrity. All sampled records show proper data structure, valid GPS coordinates, and adherence to business rules.

## Verification Methodology

- **Sample Size**: 15 randomly selected records from 70 Lawley records
- **Database**: vf-onemap-data (Firebase/Firestore)
- **Collection**: vf-onemap-processed-records
- **Import Date**: 2025-01-29
- **Total Imports**: 20+ batches completed (May 22 - June 20, 2025)

## Key Findings

### ✅ Data Completeness
- **100%** of sampled records have pole numbers
- **100%** of sampled records have GPS coordinates
- **100%** of sampled records have status values
- **100%** of sampled records have status history tracking

### ✅ Data Quality Metrics

1. **Pole Number Format**
   - All pole numbers follow the standard format: `LAW.P.XXXX`
   - Example: LAW.P.C654, LAW.P.C442, LAW.P.C473
   - No format violations detected

2. **GPS Coordinates**
   - All coordinates are valid South African locations
   - Latitude range: -26.38 to -26.39 (consistent with Lawley area)
   - Longitude range: 27.81 to 27.82 (consistent with Lawley area)
   - Sample: -26.3845209001505, 27.8107044864656

3. **Drop Number Management**
   - Unique drop numbers assigned where applicable (e.g., DR1752940)
   - "no drop allocated" properly recorded for poles without drops
   - No duplicate drop numbers found in sample
   - No poles exceeded the 12-drop maximum limit

4. **Status Tracking**
   - Valid status values present (e.g., "Pole Permission: Approved", "Home Installation: Declined")
   - Status history array implemented with date tracking
   - All records have at least one status history entry

### ✅ Data Integrity Checks
