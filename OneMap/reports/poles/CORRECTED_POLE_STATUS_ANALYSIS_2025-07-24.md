# Corrected Pole Status Analysis - July 21, 2025 Data
*Generated: 2025-07-24*

## Executive Summary

This report provides the **corrected analysis** of pole distribution and capacity utilization based on the July 21, 2025 CSV data. The original report dated 2025-07-23 contained significant errors in calculations and has been superseded by this corrected version.

## Key Corrections

### What Was Wrong in Original Report
1. **Pole count inflated by 27.5%** (claimed 3,771 vs actual 2,958)
2. **LAW.P.A788 drops inflated by 167%** (claimed 16 vs actual 6)
3. **False capacity violations** (claimed 6 poles over limit vs actual 0)
4. **Incorrect calculation methodology** (counted records instead of unique drops)

## Verified Key Metrics

### Overall Statistics
- **Total Records**: 10,351 pole-related records
- **Unique Poles**: 2,958 poles (not 3,771)
- **Average Drops per Pole**: 2.12 drops (not 2.74)
- **Maximum Drops on Any Pole**: 9 (LAW.P.A013)
- **Poles Exceeding 12-Drop Limit**: 0 (not 6)

### Pole Capacity Status

#### Distribution of Drops per Pole
| Drops per Pole | Number of Poles | Percentage |
|----------------|-----------------|------------|
| 1 drop         | 1,304 poles     | 44.1%      |
| 2 drops        | 659 poles       | 22.3%      |
| 3 drops        | 534 poles       | 18.1%      |
| 4 drops        | 297 poles       | 10.0%      |
| 5 drops        | 126 poles       | 4.3%       |
| 6 drops        | 28 poles        | 0.9%       |
| 7 drops        | 9 poles         | 0.3%       |
| 8 drops        | 0 poles         | 0.0%       |
| 9 drops        | 1 pole          | 0.0%       |

### Capacity Analysis

#### No Capacity Violations Found
- **Critical (>12 drops)**: 0 poles âœ…
- **At Capacity (12 drops)**: 0 poles
- **Near Capacity (10-11 drops)**: 0 poles
- **Well Below Capacity (<10 drops)**: 2,958 poles (100%)

### Top 5 Busiest Poles (Corrected)
1. LAW.P.A013 - 9 drops (highest in system)
2. LAW.P.C546 - 7 drops
3. LAW.P.D829 - 7 drops
4. LAW.P.A038 - 7 drops
5. LAW.P.B418 - 7 drops

### LAW.P.A788 Verification
- **Actual drops**: 6 (not 16)
- **Drop numbers**: DR1741030, DR1741029, DR1741032, DR1741033, DR1741034, DR1741035
- **Status**: Well within capacity

### Status Breakdown
| Status | Count | Percentage |
|--------|-------|------------|
| Pole Permission: Approved | 5,136 | 49.6% |
| Home Sign Ups: Approved & Installation Scheduled | 4,297 | 41.5% |
| Home Installation: In Progress | 838 | 8.1% |
| Home Sign Ups: Declined | 39 | 0.4% |
| Pole Permission: Declined | 24 | 0.2% |
| Other statuses | 17 | 0.2% |

## Data Integrity Issues

### Duplicate Drop Assignments
- **304 drop numbers assigned to multiple poles**
- This represents a data quality issue requiring attention
- Examples:
  - DR1739676 appears on 3 poles: LAW.P.A517, LAW.P.A518, LAW.P.A519
  - DR1740706 appears on 2 poles: LAW.P.A406, LAW.P.A425

## Key Findings (Corrected)

### 1. No Capacity Violations
- **All poles are within the 12-drop physical limit**
- The highest utilized pole (LAW.P.A013) has only 9 drops
- System operating at 75% of maximum capacity on busiest pole

### 2. Excellent Capacity Utilization
- **100% of poles** are operating below capacity
- Average utilization is only 17.7% (2.12 drops out of 12 max)
- Significant room for growth without infrastructure expansion

### 3. Data Quality Issues
- 304 duplicate drop assignments need resolution
- Drop numbers should be unique across the system
- Likely data entry or processing errors

### 4. Healthy Installation Progress
- Nearly 50% of records show approved pole permissions
- 41.5% have scheduled installations
- Very low decline rate (0.6% combined)

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. **Ignore Previous Report**: The 2025-07-23 report should be marked as invalid
2. **Investigate Duplicate Drops**: Resolve the 304 duplicate drop assignments
3. **Update Reporting Scripts**: Fix the script that generated incorrect numbers

### System Improvements
1. **Validation Rules**: Implement drop number uniqueness constraints
2. **Capacity Monitoring**: Although no issues found, maintain monitoring
3. **Report Generation**: Add verification steps to prevent calculation errors

## Methodology Note

This corrected analysis was generated using:
- Direct CSV parsing with proper deduplication
- Counting unique drop numbers per pole (not record counts)
- Verified with multiple independent scripts (Python and JavaScript)
- Cross-checked against raw data samples

## Conclusion

The pole infrastructure is operating **well within capacity** with no violations of the 12-drop limit. The previous report's claims of capacity issues were due to calculation errors, not actual infrastructure problems. The system shows healthy growth with excellent capacity for expansion.
