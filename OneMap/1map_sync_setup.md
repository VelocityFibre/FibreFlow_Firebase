 see our OneMap dir. the plan is to 1. get a dialy export from 1Map in.csv, 2. import the data into a processing dbase ( which we have to create 3. process and conf the data before we 
  sync it to our live firbreflow database. - deos this workflow make sence ? - the exports from 1Mpa 's fields and comlumbs may change. and we only want updated data to be synced to our 
  live dbase. and not all data to be overwrittenm everythime for obvoious reasons. pls advise - ask qestions if need be.

● Based on my analysis of your OneMap directory and documentation, your workflow approach for handling 1Map daily exports makes excellent sense. Let me provide my assessment and
  recommendations:

  Your Workflow Assessment: ✅ Excellent Strategy

  Your 3-step approach is exactly right for this use case:

  1. Daily CSV Export from 1Map → Import to processing database
  2. Process & Validate in staging environment
  3. Sync Only Changes to live FibreFlow database

  Why This Approach Works

  1. Field Changes Protection ✅

  - Processing database acts as a buffer against 1Map schema changes
  - You can adapt your processing logic without touching live data
  - Perfect for handling evolving CSV column structures

  2. Incremental Updates ✅

  - Only sync deltas to production (not full overwrites)
  - Preserves user-generated data (photos, notes, quality checks)
  - Maintains audit trail and prevents data loss

  3. Data Integrity ✅

  - Validation happens in staging before production
  - Prevents corrupt/incomplete data from reaching live system
  - Follows your existing antiHall validation patterns

  Implementation Recommendations

  Processing Database Options

● Update Todos
  ⎿  ☐ Analyze OneMap workflow and provide database recommendations

● Option 1: SQLite Processing Database (Recommended)
  # Lightweight, no server required
  # Perfect for CSV processing and validation
  # Easy to query and transform data

  Option 2: Firebase Subcollection (Alternative)
  # Use `processing-data` collection
  # Keep separate from live `planned-poles` collection
  # Easier integration with existing Firebase functions

  Recommended Architecture

  1Map Daily Export (CSV)
       ↓
  SQLite Processing DB
       ↓
  Validation & Transformation
       ↓
  Delta Detection (compare with live)
       ↓
  Sync Only Changes → FibreFlow Live DB

  Key Questions for Implementation

  1. Change Detection: How do you identify "updated" records?
    - Timestamp comparison?
    - Hash-based change detection?
    - Specific fields that indicate updates?
  2. Conflict Resolution: When 1Map data conflicts with FibreFlow data:
    - 1Map wins (overwrite)?
    - Manual review required?
    - Field-level merge strategy?
  3. Processing Schedule:
    - Real-time processing when CSV arrives?
    - Scheduled batch processing?
    - Manual trigger for processing?

  Next Steps

  Based on your existing OneMap infrastructure, I recommend:

  1. Extend existing scripts - You already have excellent CSV processing patterns
  2. Add change detection - Build on your current validation approach
  3. Implement staging sync - Similar to your current Firebase import scripts
  4. Add incremental updates - Only sync changed records

  Would you like me to help design the specific change detection logic or processing database schema? Your current OneMap foundation is solid - we just need to add the incremental
  processing layer.
