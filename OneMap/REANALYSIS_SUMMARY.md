# üìä Lawley Project - Data Analysis Summary

## üéØ Understanding the Data

### How the System Works:
- **Each row = A workflow update/status change**
- **Flow Name Groups = Complete history of all status changes**
- **Multiple entries per property = Normal workflow tracking**

## ‚úÖ What's Working Well

### 1. **Workflow Tracking System**
The system correctly tracks each property through its lifecycle:
```
Entry 1: "Pole Permission: Approved"
Entry 2: "Pole Permission: Approved, Home Sign Ups: Approved"  
Entry 3: "Pole Permission: Approved, Home Sign Ups: Approved, Home Installation: In Progress"
Entry 4: "Pole Permission: Approved, Home Sign Ups: Approved, Home Installation: In Progress, Home Installation: Installed"
```

### 2. **Property Management**
- All 14,579 Property IDs are unique
- Each property has complete audit trail
- Status progression is traceable

## ‚ùì Requires Clarification

### "1 KWENA STREET" Anomaly
- 662 workflow updates at this single address
- 355 different pole numbers
- **Needs client verification**: 
  - Is this actually a large complex?
  - Or could this be a default/home address used by field agents?
  - Possible data entry location rather than actual installation site?

## ‚ùå Issues Requiring Attention

### 1. **Pole Location Conflicts (1,811 poles)**
Poles appearing at multiple physical addresses:

| Pole | Locations | Example Addresses |
|------|-----------|-------------------|
| LAW.P.D721 | 7 | Different streets in Lawley |
| LAW.P.D714 | 7 | Multiple unrelated locations |
| LAW.P.C328 | 6 | Various streets |

**This is physically impossible - a pole cannot be in multiple locations**

### 2. **Data Entry Anomalies**
- 21 instances of bulk entries at exact same timestamp
- Example: 23 entries at "2025-07-03T00:00:00"
- Suggests system import issues

### 3. **Missing Data**
- 63% of entries lack field agent names
- Cannot verify who performed the work

## üí° Data Management Approach

### 1. **Pole Location Resolution**
```python
# Create authoritative pole registry
pole_registry = {
    'pole_number': 'LAW.P.A001',
    'verified_location': '123 Main Street',
    'coordinates': (-26.123, 27.456),
    'verified_by': 'Field Team',
    'date_verified': '2025-01-09'
}
```

### 2. **Current Status View**
```sql
-- Get latest status for each property
SELECT property_id, 
       MAX(survey_date) as latest_date,
       status as current_status
FROM records
GROUP BY property_id
```

### 3. **Workflow History Preservation**
- Keep all records as audit trail
- Use Flow Name Groups to show progression
- Filter by property_id to see complete history

## üìà Key Metrics

- **Total Properties**: 14,579 (all unique)
- **Total Poles**: 3,770
- **Poles needing location verification**: 1,811 (48%)
- **Bulk entry issues**: 21 timestamps
- **Records missing field agent**: 9,256 (63%)

## üöÄ Recommended Actions

### Immediate:
1. **Verify with client** about "1 KWENA STREET" - is it a complex or data entry location?
2. Export and field-verify the 1,811 poles with location conflicts
3. Establish single source of truth for pole locations
4. Investigate the 21 bulk entry timestamps

### System Improvements:
1. Implement pole location validation (one pole = one location)
2. Make field agent name mandatory
3. Add GPS coordinates validation
4. Prevent duplicate pole assignments across addresses

### Reporting:
1. Default view: Current status per property
2. Detail view: Complete workflow history
3. Alert view: Pole location conflicts only

## üìù Summary

The system is successfully tracking workflow stages for fiber installation. The main issues are:
1. **Pole location data quality** - nearly half the poles (1,811 out of 3,770) appear at multiple addresses
2. **"1 KWENA STREET" anomaly** - needs verification whether it's a legitimate large complex or a data entry artifact
3. **Missing field agent data** - 63% of entries lack this critical information

Once these issues are clarified and resolved, the data will accurately represent the installation progress across the Lawley project.
