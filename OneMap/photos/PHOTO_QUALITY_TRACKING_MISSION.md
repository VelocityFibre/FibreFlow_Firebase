# Photo Quality Tracking Mission

**Created:** 2025-07-31  
**Purpose:** Track and improve photo documentation quality in 1Map data  
**Status:** Active  

## Mission Overview

Track photo coverage improvements in 1Map CSV files to ensure installation quality and accountability.

## Current Baseline (July Week 4 2025)

| Metric | Value | Status |
|--------|-------|---------|
| Overall Photo Coverage | 26.3% | üî¥ Poor |
| Completed Installations | 0.0% | üö® Critical |
| In-Progress Installations | 45.0% | üü° Fair |
| Total Records Analyzed | 16,143 | ‚úÖ Good |

## Critical Issue Identified

**üö® ZERO photos for completed installations** - This prevents:
- Quality verification
- Payment validation
- Accountability tracking
- Customer dispute resolution

## Simple Tracking System

### Commands:
```bash
# Track quality for new CSV file
node scripts/simple-quality-log.js "path/to/new/file.csv"

# View improvement trends
node scripts/view-quality-trends.js
```

### Output Location:
- **Log File:** `OneMap/reports/quality-log.csv`
- **Format:** CSV (open in Excel for charts)

## Key Metrics to Monitor

1. **Completed Photo %** - Target: 100%
2. **In-Progress Photo %** - Target: 80%+
3. **Overall Photo %** - Target: 60%+

## Success Criteria

### Phase 1 - Critical Fix (Week 1-2)
- [ ] Completed installations: 0% ‚Üí 100% photo coverage
- [ ] Identify why photos missing from completed work

### Phase 2 - Process Improvement (Week 3-4)
- [ ] In-progress installations: 45% ‚Üí 80% photo coverage
- [ ] Overall coverage: 26% ‚Üí 60%

### Phase 3 - Optimization (Month 2)
- [ ] Maintain 100% completed photo coverage
- [ ] Achieve 80%+ overall photo coverage
- [ ] Zero quality regressions

## Action Items

### Immediate (This Week)
1. **Analyze newer 1Map files** - Check if quality improves
2. **Run tracking on latest CSV** - Establish current trend
3. **Flag critical installations** - Completed without photos

### Short Term (Next 2 Weeks)
1. **Review field process** - Why are completed installations missing photos?
2. **Update field app** - Prevent completion without photos
3. **Train installers** - Photo requirements mandatory

### Long Term (Next Month)
1. **Monitor trends weekly** - Track improvements
2. **Quality alerts** - Automated flagging system
3. **Performance tracking** - By installer/agent

4. Report improvements to management

## Expected Timeline

| Week | Target | Action |
|------|--------|---------|
| 1 | Establish baseline | Track all available CSV files |
| 2-3 | Identify root causes | Analyze why photos missing |
| 4-6 | Process improvements | Fix field app/training |
| 7-8 | Quality validation | Verify 100% completed coverage |
| 9+ | Continuous monitoring | Weekly quality reviews |

## Success Indicators
