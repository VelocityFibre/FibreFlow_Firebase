# PowerBI Testing Checklist for Ettienne

## 🎯 Testing Objectives
Verify that PowerBI can connect to FibreFlow data and build useful dashboards without the current connection/mapping issues.

## 📋 Pre-Testing Setup
- [ ] PowerBI Desktop installed and updated
- [ ] Stable internet connection
- [ ] Access to `IMPLEMENTATION_COMPLETE.md` for connection details

## 🔌 Connection Testing

### Step 1: Basic Connection
- [ ] Open PowerBI Desktop
- [ ] Get Data → PostgreSQL database
- [ ] Enter server details from implementation guide
- [ ] Connection succeeds without errors
- [ ] Can authenticate with powerbi_reader credentials

**Expected Result**: Clean connection to Neon database

### Step 2: Data Discovery
- [ ] Can see `bi_views` schema in Navigator
- [ ] Can see all 3 views: property_status, agent_performance, project_summary
- [ ] Preview shows readable column names (not technical IDs)
- [ ] Data loads without timeout errors

**Expected Result**: Business-friendly column names, 191+ property records

## 📊 Data Quality Testing

### Step 3: Property Status Data
Load `bi_views.property_status` and verify:
- [ ] Property ID, Pole Number, Drop Number fields populated
- [ ] Status categories make business sense
- [ ] Agent names are readable (not IDs)
- [ ] Address and Zone information available
- [ ] "Has Pole" and "Has Drop" indicators work for filtering

**Expected Result**: 191 records with clean, usable data

### Step 4: Agent Performance Data  
Load `bi_views.agent_performance` and verify:
- [ ] Agent names listed
- [ ] Completion rates calculated correctly
- [ ] Performance metrics make sense
- [ ] Can identify top/bottom performers

**Expected Result**: Agent metrics ready for performance dashboards

## 🎨 Dashboard Building Testing

### Step 5: Create Basic Visualizations
Try building these to test functionality:
- [ ] **Property Status Chart**: Count by Status Category
- [ ] **Agent Performance Table**: Agent Name vs Completion Rate
- [ ] **Geographic View**: Properties by Zone
- [ ] **Pole Assignment**: Has Pole vs No Pole comparison

**Expected Result**: Charts/visuals build easily with intuitive data

### Step 6: Dashboard Functionality
- [ ] Visuals refresh quickly (< 5 seconds)
- [ ] Filters work across visualizations
- [ ] Data relationships make sense
- [ ] No errors when building complex reports

## 🔄 Refresh & Performance Testing

### Step 7: Refresh Testing
- [ ] Click "Refresh" in PowerBI
- [ ] Data reloads without connection errors
- [ ] No re-authentication required
- [ ] Performance remains acceptable

**Expected Result**: Smooth refresh without re-setup

### Step 8: Performance Assessment
Rate the following (1-5, where 5 is excellent):
- [ ] Initial connection speed: ___/5
- [ ] Data loading speed: ___/5  
- [ ] Dashboard refresh speed: ___/5
- [ ] Overall responsiveness: ___/5

**Target**: All ratings ≥ 3, ideally ≥ 4

## 🐛 Issue Identification

### Common Issues to Watch For:
- [ ] **SSL Certificate warnings** - Should work with "Trust Server Certificate"
- [ ] **Connection timeouts** - Should be resolved with pooler endpoint
- [ ] **Mapping difficulties** - Should be eliminated with business-friendly views
- [ ] **Empty views** - Some views (project_summary) may have 0 records initially

### If Problems Occur:
Document:
1. **Exact error message**
2. **When it occurred** (connection, loading, refresh, etc.)
3. **Workaround attempted**
4. **Impact on usability**

## ✅ Success Criteria

### Minimum Success (Must Achieve):
- [ ] PowerBI connects reliably
- [ ] Can load property status data  
- [ ] Column names are business-friendly
- [ ] Can build at least 2 basic charts

### Ideal Success (Goal):
- [ ] All views accessible and useful
- [ ] Fast performance (< 5 sec refresh)
- [ ] No technical mapping required
- [ ] Can build complete operational dashboard
- [ ] Ettienne says "This is much easier than before!"
