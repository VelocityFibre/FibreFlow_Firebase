2. **Codebase Scanner** - Need to understand the code
3. **Basic Enhancement** - Core value proposition
4. **Simple CLI** - User interface

### Phase 2: Intelligence (Should Have)
1. **Pattern Recognition** - Major value add
2. **Decision Tracking** - Prevents repeated mistakes
3. **Smart Context** - Improves relevance
4. **Caching** - Cost optimization

### Phase 3: Polish (Nice to Have)
