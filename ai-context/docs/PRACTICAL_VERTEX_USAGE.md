# Practical Vertex AI Usage for FibreFlow

## üéØ Core Value Propositions

### 1. **Context Memory System**
**Problem**: Every Claude Code conversation starts fresh
**Solution**: Vertex AI maintains persistent context across all sessions

```bash
# First conversation
vertex remember "We decided to use signals instead of BehaviorSubject for state management"

# Weeks later
vertex recall "state management"
# Returns: "Previous decision: Use signals instead of BehaviorSubject (decided 2024-01-15)"
```

### 2. **Pattern Enforcement**
**Problem**: Developers (and AI) forget established patterns
**Solution**: Vertex AI actively enforces patterns

```bash
vertex check "this.items$ = new BehaviorSubject<Item[]>([])"
# Returns: "‚ùå Violation: Use signals instead. Replace with: items = signal<Item[]>([])"
```

### 3. **Codebase Analysis**
**Problem**: Hard to find similar implementations
**Solution**: Vertex AI knows every pattern in your codebase

```bash
vertex find "services that use real-time updates"
# Returns list of services using Firestore listeners with code examples
```

## üîß Practical Integration Patterns

### Pattern 1: Pre-Claude Enhancement (Current Focus)
```bash
# Before asking Claude Code
vertex enhance "Add Excel export to pole tracker"

# Vertex returns enhanced prompt with:
- Similar Excel exports in BOQ module
- Specific libraries already in use
- File naming conventions
- Testing patterns
```

### Pattern 2: Code Review Assistant
```python
# agents/code_reviewer.py
class CodeReviewAgent:
    """Reviews code against FibreFlow standards"""
    
    def review(self, file_path):
        violations = []
        
        # Check for anti-patterns
        if "BehaviorSubject" in code:
            violations.append("Use signals instead")
            
        # Check imports
        if "AngularFirestore" in code:
            violations.append("Use modular Firebase imports")
            
        return violations
```

### Pattern 3: Data Analysis Helper
```python
# For OneMap/Pole data analysis
class DataAnalysisAgent:
    """Specialized for FibreFlow data structures"""
    
    def analyze_poles(self, query):
        # Understands pole/drop relationships
        # Knows capacity limits (12 drops/pole)
        # Validates data integrity
        pass
```

## üìä Specific Use Cases for FibreFlow

### 1. **OneMap Data Processing**
```python
# Vertex understands your data model
vertex analyze-data """
Find all poles in Lawley with:
- More than 10 drops
- Status 'Approved'
- No installation date
"""

# Returns SQL/Firebase queries with proper joins
```

### 2. **Performance Optimization**
```python
vertex optimize """
The project list takes 5 seconds to load
"""

# Vertex analyzes:
- Current query structure
- Missing indexes
- Unnecessary data fetching
- Suggests specific optimizations
```

### 3. **Architecture Decisions**
```python
vertex decide """
Should we denormalize user data in projects collection?
"""

# Vertex considers:
- Current query patterns
- Update frequency
- Consistency requirements
- Returns recommendation with trade-offs
```

### 4. **Migration Planning**
```python
vertex plan-migration """
Migrate from Firestore to PostgreSQL for reporting
"""

# Generates:
- Phase-by-phase plan
- Data model translations
- Query conversions
- Risk assessment
```

        self.feedback_db = FeedbackDatabase()
        self.pattern_learner = PatternLearner()
        
    def learn(self, request, suggestion, correction):
        # Store what worked/didn't work
        self.feedback_db.store(request, suggestion, correction)
        
        # Update patterns
        self.pattern_learner.update(correction)
        
    def suggest(self, request):
        # Use learned patterns
        base_suggestion = self.generate(request)

## üéØ The Bottom Line

Vertex AI's value for FibreFlow development:

1. **Memory**: Never explain patterns again
2. **Consistency**: Enforce patterns automatically
3. **Speed**: Find examples instantly
4. **Quality**: Prevent common mistakes
5. **Learning**: Gets better over time

The goal isn't to replace Claude Code - it's to make Claude Code 10x more effective by giving it perfect context every time.
