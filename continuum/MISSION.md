# Continuum Module: Mission Statement

## The Problem: Context Decay and Inefficient Task Resumption

As a development team (even a team of one person and one AI), we face a significant challenge: **context decay**.

1.  **Losing the "Why":** When we pause work on a complex task (like implementing the MPMS), we quickly lose the high-level context. Why did we choose a specific approach? What were the trade-offs we considered? What was the ultimate goal of the last piece of code we wrote?

2.  **Forgetting the "What's Next":** The most immediate problem is forgetting the exact next step. This leads to wasted time re-reading code, logs, and documentation to figure out where we left off. This friction discourages frequent context switching and makes it hard to juggle multiple priorities (e.g., a feature, a bug fix, and a refactor).

3.  **Lack of a Single View:** We have multiple long-running initiatives (MPMS, Pole Tracker Grid, OneMap imports). There is no single place to see the status of all these tasks, making it difficult to prioritize and manage the overall project.

In short, the absence of a formal system to persist our working context means every pause is costly, and every resumption is inefficient.

## The Proposed Solution: "Continuum" - A Stateful Task Management System

I propose we create a new, dedicated module called **Continuum**. Its sole purpose is to solve the context decay problem by treating each major task as a "stateful object" that is managed on the filesystem.

This system will be our **single source of truth** for all ongoing work. Hereâ€™s how it will work:

1.  **The Task File: The "Why" and "What"**
    *   For each major task (e.g., `implement-mpms`), we'll create a simple JSON file (e.g., `continuum/tasks/implement-mpms.json`).
    *   This file will define the task's **goal**, list the **key files and resources** involved, and outline the **high-level plan**. It's the static "constitution" for the task.

2.  **The Action Log: The "How" and "Where We Are"**
    *   Each task will have a corresponding log file (e.g., `continuum/logs/implement-mpms.log.md`).
    *   This log will be a **chronological, human-readable record of every single action** taken to complete the task. Every file created, every function modified, every command run will be an entry.
    *   Crucially, this log provides the **"resume point."** The last line of the log is the last thing we did. The next step is simply what we need to do next according to the plan.

3.  **The Central Registry: The "Single Entry Point"**
    *   A master file, `continuum/continuum.json`, will list all tasks currently being managed.
    *   It will provide a high-level dashboard view of every task, its current status (`active`, `paused`, `completed`), and when it was last worked on. This allows us to see the entire project's workload at a glance.

4.  **The CLI: The Simple Interface**
    *   We will interact with this system through a simple command-line script, `continuum.js`. This script will provide simple commands to manage the lifecycle of a task:
        *   `continuum start <task_name> "[description]"`: To begin a new task.
        *   `continuum log <task_name> "[action_taken]"`: To record a completed step.
        *   `continuum pause <task_name> "[reason]"`: To mark a task as paused.
        *   `continuum resume <task_name>`: To see the last action and resume work.
        *   `continuum status`: To see the status of all tasks.

**How This Solves the Problem:**

*   **Eliminates Context Decay:** The "why" is in the task file, and the "how" is in the action log. The entire history is preserved on disk.
*   **Creates a Perfect Resume Point:** To continue work, we simply ask for the status of the task. The system will show us the last logged action, making the next step obvious.
*   **Enables Efficient Context Switching:** We can pause the `MPMS` task, work on a critical bug, and then seamlessly resume the `MPMS` task without losing our place.
*   **Provides a Clear Audit Trail:** The action logs become a detailed, step-by-step history of how each feature was built, which is invaluable for debugging and documentation.

This system would provide the single, unified entry point you're looking for to manage our work effectively and ensure we can always pick up exactly where we left off.
