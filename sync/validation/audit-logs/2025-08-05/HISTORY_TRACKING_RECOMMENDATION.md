# Status History Tracking - Final Recommendation
**Date**: 2025-08-05  
**Purpose**: Recommend best approach for status history tracking

---

## Test Results

### Full History Approach - Memory Issue
When attempting to process all 38 CSV files with full history preservation:
- Successfully processed files with status change detection
- Detected 841+ status changes across the dataset
- **Failed**: Out of memory error when keeping 300,000+ records in memory

### Analysis
The dataset is larger than anticipated:
- 38 files × ~10,000 records each = ~380,000 total records
- Keeping all in memory requires ~1-2GB RAM
- Not scalable for production use

## Recommended Approach: Hybrid Solution

### Option 1: Stream-Based Full History (Best for Complete History)
Modify the full history script to:
1. Stream records directly to CSV file (don't keep in memory)
2. Use streaming CSV writer
3. Track only status map in memory (Property ID → Last Status)

**Pros**: Complete history, memory efficient
**Cons**: Large output file (100-200MB)

### Option 2: Status History in Separate Column (Best for Compact Storage)
Modify the current FIXED script to:
1. Add `_status_history` column containing JSON array
2. Append status changes to the array
3. Keep single record per Property ID

**Example**:
```
Property ID | Current Status | _status_history
123456 | Installed | ["2025-05-22:Requested","2025-06-15:Approved","2025-07-18:Installed"]
```

**Pros**: Compact, preserves history, Excel-friendly
**Cons**: Status history in single cell (harder to query)

### Option 3: Two-File Approach (Best Balance)
1. **master_csv_latest.csv** - Current state only (as now)
2. **status_history_log.csv** - All status changes only

**Status History Log Format**:
```
Property ID | Date | Previous Status | New Status | Source File
123456 | 2025-06-15 | Requested | Approved | June15.csv
123456 | 2025-07-18 | Approved | Installed | July18.csv
```

**Pros**: 
- Main CSV stays manageable
- Full history available separately
- Easy to query both files
- Memory efficient

**Cons**: Two files to manage

## Final Recommendation

### ✅ Implement Option 3: Two-File Approach

**Reasons**:
1. **Practical**: Keeps main CSV at reasonable size
2. **Complete**: Full history preserved in separate file
3. **Flexible**: Can use either or both files as needed
4. **Efficient**: No memory issues, fast processing
5. **Simple**: Easy to implement and understand

### Implementation Plan
1. Keep the current FIXED script as-is for main CSV
2. Create a new script `create-status-history-log.js` that:
   - Processes files chronologically
   - Outputs only status changes
   - Streams directly to file
3. Run both scripts to generate both outputs

### Usage
```bash
# Generate main CSV (current state)
./CREATE_MASTER_CSV.sh

# Generate status history log
./CREATE_STATUS_HISTORY_LOG.sh

# Result: Two complementary files
# - master_csv_latest.csv (35MB, current state)
# - status_history_log.csv (5MB, all changes)
```

## Conclusion

While full history in a single file would be ideal, the two-file approach provides the best balance of completeness, performance, and usability. It preserves all historical data while keeping files at manageable sizes for analysis tools like Excel.
