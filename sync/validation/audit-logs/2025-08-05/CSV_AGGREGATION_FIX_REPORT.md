**Purpose**: Fix column alignment issues in master CSV aggregation  
**Result**: ✅ SUCCESS

---

## Root Cause Analysis

### Issue Identified (2025-08-04)
The CSV aggregation process had critical column mapping errors:
- Headers collected as unordered Set, causing misalignment
- Data from different CSV files mapped to wrong columns
- Example: Pole numbers appearing in "Drop Number" or "Survey Date" fields
- Affected 26,230 records in previous aggregation

### Solution Implemented
1. **Fixed BOM Characters**: Removed UTF-8 BOM from 37 CSV files
2. **Created Fixed Aggregation Script**: `create-master-csv-with-changes-FIXED.js`
   - Defined canonical column order (283 columns)
   - Normalized all records to master schema
   - Ensured consistent field mapping across all files

## Results

### CSV Processing Summary
- **Files Processed**: 38 CSV files
- **Date Range**: 2025-05-22 to 2025-07-18
- **Total Records**: 35,367 (excluding header)
- **Changes Tracked**: 28,125
- **Processing Status**: ✅ Completed successfully

### Data Quality Verification
**Test Case: Pole LAW.P.C654**
- **Before Fix**: Appeared in wrong columns (Drop Number, Survey Date)
- **After Fix**: Correctly positioned in "Pole Number" column
- **Records Found**: 2 (matching database records)
  - Record 1: Property ID empty, Status: "Home Installation: Declined"
  - Record 2: Property ID 110988, Status: "Pole Permission: Approved"

### Column Alignment Verification
```
✅ Property ID → Column 1 (correct)
✅ Pole Number → Column 16 (correct)
✅ Drop Number → Column 17 (correct)
✅ Survey Date → Column 19 (correct)
✅ All 283 columns properly mapped
```

## Recommendations

1. **Use Fixed CSV for Validation**: The corrected master CSV is now suitable for database validation
2. **Archive Old Master CSV**: Previous versions have corrupt column mappings
3. **Update Import Scripts**: Ensure future imports use the canonical column order
4. **Regular Validation**: Run periodic checks to ensure data integrity
