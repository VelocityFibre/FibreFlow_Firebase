# Status History Tracking Solution Summary
**Date**: 2025-08-05  
**Status**: ✅ IMPLEMENTED

---

## Solution Overview

We've implemented a **two-file approach** that provides complete status history while maintaining efficiency:

1. **Master CSV** (`master_csv_latest.csv`) - Current state only
2. **Status History Log** (`status_history_log_latest.csv`) - All status changes

---

## How It Works

### File 1: Master CSV (Existing - Fixed)
- Contains the **latest state** of each property
- One record per Property ID
- Shows current status, location, pole number, etc.
- Size: ~35MB for 35,000 properties

### File 2: Status History Log (New)
- Contains **only status changes**
- Multiple records per Property ID (one per change)
- Shows: Property ID, Date, Previous Status → New Status
- Size: ~5-10MB (much smaller)

---

## Example Output

### Master CSV (Current State):
```
Property ID | Status | Pole Number | Address
123456 | Home Installation: Installed | LAW.P.B167 | 123 Main St
```

### Status History Log (Changes Only):
```
Property ID | Change Date | Previous Status | New Status | Source File
123456 | 2025-05-22 | | Pole Permission: Requested | May22.csv
123456 | 2025-06-15 | Pole Permission: Requested | Pole Permission: Approved | June15.csv
123456 | 2025-07-01 | Pole Permission: Approved | Home Sign Ups: Scheduled | July01.csv
123456 | 2025-07-18 | Home Sign Ups: Scheduled | Home Installation: Installed | July18.csv
```

## Benefits

1. **Complete History**: No data loss - all status changes preserved
2. **Efficient**: Streams data, doesn't load all in memory
3. **Practical**: Files stay at manageable sizes
4. **Flexible**: Can analyze current state OR history
5. **Simple**: Easy to understand and use

---

## Usage Instructions

### Generate Both Files:
```bash
cd OneMap/GraphAnalysis

# 1. Generate master CSV (current state)
./CREATE_MASTER_CSV.sh

# 2. Generate status history log
./CREATE_STATUS_HISTORY_LOG.sh
```

### Analysis Examples:

**Find all properties at a specific status:**
```sql
SELECT * FROM master_csv WHERE Status = 'Home Installation: Installed'
```

**Track a specific property's journey:**
```sql
SELECT * FROM status_history_log WHERE "Property ID" = '123456' ORDER BY "Change Date"
```

**Count status changes by month:**
```sql
SELECT SUBSTR("Change Date",1,7) as Month, COUNT(*) 
FROM status_history_log 
GROUP BY Month
```

**Find properties that changed status multiple times:**
```sql
SELECT "Property ID", COUNT(*) as changes 
FROM status_history_log 
GROUP BY "Property ID" 
HAVING changes > 3
```

## Files Created

1. **Scripts**:
   - `processors/create-status-history-log.js` - Main processor
   - `CREATE_STATUS_HISTORY_LOG.sh` - Shell script to run it

2. **Output Files**:
   - `data/master/master_csv_latest.csv` - Current state
   - `data/master/status_history_log_latest.csv` - Status changes

3. **Documentation**:

## Conclusion

The two-file approach successfully provides complete status history tracking while avoiding memory issues and keeping files at practical sizes. This solution is:
- ✅ Simple to implement and use
- ✅ Memory efficient
- ✅ Preserves all historical data
- ✅ Ready for production use

You now have full visibility into both the current state AND the complete history of status changes for all properties.
