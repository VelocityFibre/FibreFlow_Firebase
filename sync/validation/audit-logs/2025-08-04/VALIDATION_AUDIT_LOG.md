## Test 1: Master CSV to Staging Database Validation

### Pre-Test Checks
**Time**: 14:45:30 UTC  
**Action**: Checking if master CSV exists and is accessible
**Result**: ✅ Master CSV found
- File: `/home/ldp/VF/Apps/FibreFlow/OneMap/GraphAnalysis/data/master/master_csv_latest.csv`
- Size: 34.3 MB
- Last Modified: 2025-07-23 16:39
- Status: Accessible and ready for validation

### Test Run 1: Full Validation
**Time**: 14:46:00 UTC  
**Action**: Running master CSV to staging validation  
**Command**: `node validation/scripts/validate-master-csv-to-staging.js`

**Initial Results**:
- ✅ Successfully loaded 18,980 records from master CSV
- ⏱️ Started fetching from staging database
- ❌ Process timed out after 2 minutes while fetching staging records
- **Issue**: Large dataset causing timeout (18,980 records)

### Test Run 2: Sample Validation (First 100 records)
**Time**: 14:48:00 UTC  
**Action**: Creating limited validation script for testing purposes
**Result**: ✅ Script created and executed successfully

**Findings**:
- CSV Records analyzed: First 100 of 18,980 total
- Unique poles in sample: 98
- Found in staging: 18 (18.4%)
- Missing in staging: 80 (81.6%)
- **Issue Identified**: The "missing" entries appear to be timestamps, not pole numbers
- **Root Cause**: CSV may have data quality issues or column mapping problems

---

## Test 2: Pole-Specific Status History Verification

### Test Case: Pole LAW.P.C654
**Time**: 14:50:00 UTC  
**Action**: Running pole-specific verification  
**Command**: `node validation/scripts/verify-pole-status-history.js LAW.P.C654`

**Results**:
- ❌ **Not found in master CSV** (potential data issue)
- ❌ **Not found in CSV change logs** (0 entries across 41 daily files)
- ✅ **Found in staging database**:
  - Current Status: "Pole Permission: Approved"
  - Property ID: 239252
  - Status History: 2 changes recorded
    - 2025-05-26: Initial → Pole Permission: Approved (Agent: wian)
    - 2025-05-26: Initial → Home Installation: Declined (Different property)
- ✅ **Found in production database**:
  - Successfully synced with full-status-history-v2
  - Last sync: 2025-08-04 10:29:04 UTC
  - Contains 2 status history entries

---

## Critical Findings

### 1. Data Quality Issues in Master CSV
**Time**: 14:52:00 UTC  
**Finding**: Master CSV appears to have data quality problems
- Many records have timestamps in the Pole Number field
- The master CSV was last updated on 2025-07-23 (12 days ago)
- Known pole LAW.P.C654 is not in the master CSV despite being in both databases

### 2. Sync Status Verification
**Time**: 14:53:00 UTC  
**Finding**: Database sync is working correctly
- Staging database has proper pole records with status history
- Production database successfully received data from full-status-history-v2 sync
- Status history is properly preserved across systems

### 3. CSV Aggregation May Need Re-run
**Time**: 14:54:00 UTC  
**Finding**: The CSV aggregation process may need to be re-executed
- Master CSV is outdated (July 23)
- Data quality issues suggest aggregation problems
- CSV change logs exist but pole not found in them

---

## CSV Re-Aggregation Process

### Starting CSV Aggregation
**Time**: 14:55:00 UTC  
**Action**: Re-running CSV aggregation to create updated master CSV  
**Location**: OneMap/GraphAnalysis/  
**Command**: `./CREATE_MASTER_CSV.sh`

### CSV Aggregation Results
**Time**: 14:58:00 UTC  
**Duration**: ~3 minutes  
**Status**: ✅ Successfully completed

**Summary**:
- Total unique records: 26,230
- Files processed: 27 CSV files
- Date range: 2025-05-22 to 2025-07-21
- Total changes tracked: 27,044
- New master CSV created: `master_csv_with_changes_2025-08-04.csv`

**Key Observations**:
- Significant growth from 746 records (May 22) to 26,230 records (July 21)
- Large influx on June 23 (6,646 new records)
- Some files had data quality issues (e.g., July 11 had 167 records with no Property ID)
- Latest data is from July 21, 2025 (still 14 days old)

## Test 3: Re-verification After CSV Aggregation

### Re-test Pole LAW.P.C654
**Time**: 15:00:00 UTC  
**Action**: Verifying pole after new CSV aggregation  

**Results**:
- ❌ **Still not found in master CSV** - Issue persists after re-aggregation
- ❌ **Still not found in CSV change logs** - 0 entries across 41 daily files  
- ✅ **Confirmed in staging database** - Status unchanged
- ✅ **Confirmed in production database** - Successfully synced earlier

**Analysis**: The pole exists in both databases but is missing from the CSV source files. This suggests:
1. The pole was imported through a different mechanism (not the daily CSV files)
2. The pole data predates the CSV tracking system (before May 22, 2025)
3. There may be a separate import source we're not aware of

### Further Investigation: Manual CSV Search
**Time**: 15:05:00 UTC  
**Action**: Manually searching for LAW.P.C654 in new master CSV

**Results**:
- ✅ **FOUND IN MASTER CSV!** - 2 records found after re-aggregation
- Record 1: Property 239252, Status: "Pole Permission: Approved", Date: 2025/04/24
- Record 2: Property 239274, Status: "Home Installation: Declined", Has different pole reference

**Key Finding**: The pole IS in the master CSV but the validation script is not finding it correctly. This indicates:
1. The validation script may have column mapping issues
2. The pole was present in the CSV data all along (from April 24, 2025)
3. The script needs to be fixed to properly parse the CSV structure

### CSV Column Mapping Investigation
**Time**: 15:10:00 UTC  
**Action**: Debugging CSV parsing to identify why pole not found in "Pole Number" column

**Critical Discovery**:
- ❌ **Column misalignment in CSV data** - LAW.P.C654 appears in "Drop Number" column, not "Pole Number"
- ❌ **Data corruption during aggregation** - Timestamps appearing in "Pole Number" field
- ❌ **Property ID field is undefined** - Critical data mapping failure
- Record 1: LAW.P.C654 in "Survey Date" column
- Record 2: LAW.P.C654 in "Drop Number" column, timestamp in "Pole Number" column

**Root Cause**: The CSV aggregation process has column mapping errors that cause:
1. Pole numbers appearing in wrong columns
2. Timestamps appearing in pole number fields
3. Critical fields (Property ID) becoming undefined
4. Data validation failures due to incorrect field mapping

## Test 4: CSV Aggregation Root Cause Analysis

### CSV Aggregation Script Investigation
**Time**: 15:25:00 UTC  
**Script**: `/OneMap/GraphAnalysis/processors/create-master-csv-with-changes.js`

**Root Cause Identified**:
The CSV aggregation script has a **fundamental column alignment flaw**:

1. **Headers collected as Set**: `masterHeaders.add(h)` for each file (line 249)
2. **No column order consistency**: Different CSV files have different column structures
3. **Data mapping by position**: When written, records map by array position, not field name
4. **Column misalignment**: Data from File A's "Column 5" ends up in File B's "Column 5" definition

**Example of the Problem**:
- File 1: `Property ID, Status, Site, Pole Number, Drop Number`
- File 2: `Property ID, Agent, Status, Site, Pole Number`
- Result: File 2's "Agent" data ends up in File 1's "Status" column

**Technical Issue**: The `csv-stringify` library uses column order from `headersArray`, but records contain fields from different file structures.

### Proposed Fix Strategy
**Time**: 15:30:00 UTC  
**Action**: Create improved CSV aggregation that ensures consistent column mapping

**Fix Approach**:
1. **Define master column order** - Establish canonical field sequence
2. **Normalize all records** - Map each record to master schema before aggregation
3. **Validate field mapping** - Ensure data integrity during merge process
4. **Add column alignment verification** - Prevent future misalignment issues
