# ⚠️ ARCHIVED SCRIPTS - DO NOT USE

These scripts have been archived as of August 4, 2025.

## Why Archived?
These scripts only synced poles at "Approved" status without tracking post-approval changes.
They have been replaced by `sync-full-status-history-v2.js` which provides complete lifecycle tracking.

## Archived Scripts:
- `sync-with-status-history.js` - Old main sync (limited to approved only)
- `sync-remaining-poles.js` - Continuation script for old sync
- `sync-all-approved-poles.js` - Bulk sync without history
- `test-sync.js` - Test for old sync approach
- `create-pre-sync-report.js` - Pre-sync analysis for old approach
- `sync-full-status-history.js` - Version 1 (had issues)
- `test-full-history-sync.js` - Test for v1

## Use Instead:
- **Main Sync**: `../sync-full-status-history-v2.js`
- **Test**: `../test-full-history-sync-v2.js`
- **Monitor**: `../monitor-sync.js`
- **Verify**: `../verify-all-approved-synced.js`
