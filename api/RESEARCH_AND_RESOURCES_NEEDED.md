# Research and Resources Needed for API Development

*Date: 2025-08-16*  
*Purpose: Guide for gathering information that will enhance API development*

## What I Already Know âœ…

### Technical Knowledge
- REST API design principles
- Firebase Functions architecture
- Express.js middleware patterns
- Authentication strategies (JWT, OAuth, Firebase Auth)
- Input validation and sanitization
- Error handling patterns
- Rate limiting strategies
- CORS configuration
- TypeScript/JavaScript

### What I Can Build Without Additional Resources
- Basic CRUD endpoints
- Authentication middleware
- Validation logic
- Standard error responses
- Database operations (Firestore)
- File upload handling
- Real-time subscriptions

## What Would Help Me Build Better APIs ðŸŽ¯

### 1. **Business Logic Documentation**

#### Pole Data Validation Rules
**What I need to know:**
- Exact pole number format (regex pattern)
- Valid pole number prefixes by area
- GPS coordinate boundaries for projects
- Required photo types and minimum quality
- Business rules for duplicate detection

**Example questions:**
```
- Is "LAW.P.B167" the only valid format?
- Can pole numbers have lowercase?
- What's the maximum distance a pole can be from project boundary?
- How do we handle poles captured at wrong GPS location?
```

#### Workflow Rules
**What I need to know:**
- Who can approve staging data?
- What fields can be edited after approval?
- Automatic approval criteria
- Escalation rules for conflicts
- SLA for data validation

**Create a document like:**
```markdown
# Pole Validation Business Rules

## Pole Number Format
- Pattern: `^[A-Z]{3}\.P\.[A-Z]\d{3}$`
- Example: LAW.P.B167
- Prefixes: LAW (Lawley), MOH (Mohadin), etc.

## GPS Validation
- Must be within 50m of planned location
- If >50m, flag for manual review
- Accuracy must be <10m

## Photo Requirements
- Minimum 6 photos required
- Types: before, front, side, depth, concrete, compaction
- Minimum resolution: 1024x768
- Maximum age: 24 hours
```

### 2. **Neon Database Schema**

**What I need:**
```sql
-- Your Neon database schema
CREATE TABLE poles (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  pole_number VARCHAR(20) UNIQUE,
  gps_lat DECIMAL(10, 8),
  gps_lng DECIMAL(11, 8),
  -- etc...
);

-- Include all tables, indexes, and relationships
```

**Why this helps:**
- I can write optimized queries
- Understand relationships
- Plan data synchronization
- Design analytics endpoints

### 3. **Integration Requirements**

#### Power BI Connection
**What I need to know:**
- What specific data does Power BI need?
- Required response format (JSON structure)
- Refresh frequency expectations
- Authentication method (API key format)
- Any specific calculated fields needed

**Example document:**
```markdown
# Power BI Integration Requirements

## Dashboard KPIs
1. Total poles installed by day/week/month
2. Installation rate by contractor
3. Quality score by area
4. Average time from capture to approval

## Data Format
{
  "metrics": {
    "period": "2025-08-16",
    "installations": 45,
    "approvalRate": 0.89
  }
}
```

#### External System APIs
**If connecting to other systems:**
- API documentation
- Authentication methods
- Rate limits
- Data formats
- Error codes

### 4. **Security & Compliance Requirements**

**What I need to know:**
- Data privacy requirements (POPIA compliance?)
- Audit trail requirements
- Data retention policies
- Encryption requirements
- IP whitelisting needs

**Example:**
```markdown
# Security Requirements

## Data Privacy
- No PII in logs
- Encrypt sensitive fields
- 90-day data retention

## Audit Requirements
- Log all data modifications
- Track user actions
- Immutable audit trail
```

### 5. **Performance Requirements**

**What I need to know:**
- Expected number of field workers
- Peak usage times
- Acceptable response times
- Data volume projections
- Offline sync batch sizes

**Example:**
```markdown
# Performance Targets

## Load Expectations
- 500 concurrent field workers
- 10,000 API calls/hour peak
- <200ms response time (95th percentile)
- 100 poles per sync batch maximum
```

### 6. **Error Scenarios and Business Logic**

**What happens when:**
- Duplicate pole numbers detected?
- GPS location doesn't match plan?
- Photos are missing/corrupt?
- Network fails during sync?
- Validation conflicts occur?

**Document like:**
```markdown
# Error Handling Scenarios

## Duplicate Pole Number
- Check if same user (allow update)
- Check if different user (flag for review)
- Auto-merge if GPS within 5m
- Escalate if GPS differs >5m
```

## Resources That Would Be Helpful ðŸ“š

### 1. **Existing System Documentation**
- Current Firestore data models
- Firebase security rules
- Existing validation logic in Angular services
- Current user roles and permissions

### 2. **Sample Data**
- Example pole records (all fields)
- Valid/invalid test cases
- Edge cases that caused issues
- Production data samples (anonymized)

### 3. **API Examples from Similar Systems**
If you have examples from:
- Other field data collection systems
- Utility company APIs
- Geographic data systems
- Offline-first mobile apps

### 4. **Specific Technology Decisions**
- Preferred error code format
- Logging requirements (format, retention)
- Monitoring tools (Sentry, DataDog?)
- API versioning strategy
- Documentation format (OpenAPI/Swagger?)

## How to Provide This Information

### Option 1: Create Documents
Create these files in the `api/docs/` folder:
- `business-rules.md`
- `neon-schema.sql`
- `integration-requirements.md`
- `security-requirements.md`
- `performance-targets.md`

### Option 2: Answer Templates
Fill in these templates:

```markdown
## Pole Number Validation
Format: _______________
Valid prefixes: _______________
Case sensitive: Yes/No
Examples of valid: _______________
Examples of invalid: _______________

## GPS Validation
Max distance from plan: _____m
Required accuracy: _____m
Boundary check: Yes/No
Project area restriction: Yes/No

## Photo Requirements
Minimum count: _____
Required types: _______________
Max file size: _____MB
Accepted formats: _______________
```

### Option 3: Existing Code Review
Point me to:
- Current validation functions
- Service files with business logic
- Model definitions
- Configuration files

## What This Enables

With this information, I can:

1. **Build Smarter Validation**
   - Catch errors before they reach staging
   - Provide specific error messages
   - Auto-fix common issues

2. **Optimize Performance**
   - Right-size rate limits
   - Implement proper caching
   - Design efficient batch operations

3. **Ensure Compliance**
   - Meet all security requirements
   - Proper audit trails
   - Correct data handling

4. **Better Integration**
   - Exact format for Power BI
   - Proper Neon queries
   - Seamless sync with existing systems

## Priority Information

**Must Have** (Blocks development):
1. Pole number format/validation rules
2. Required fields for pole records
3. User roles and permissions

**Should Have** (Improves quality):
1. Neon database schema
2. Business workflow rules
3. Error handling scenarios

**Nice to Have** (Optimizations):
1. Performance targets
2. Integration specifications
3. Sample data

---

## Quick Start

Don't feel overwhelmed! Start with:

1. **One validation rule** (e.g., pole number format)
2. **Basic field list** (what data must be captured)
3. **Simple workflow** (capture â†’ validate â†’ approve)

We can build iteratively and add complexity as we learn more about the business requirements.

Would you like me to create template documents for any of these areas?
