# Moving FF_React Directory

## Current Location
The FF_React project is currently located at:
```
/home/ldp/VF/Apps/FibreFlow/FF_React
```

## Moving to Same Level as FibreFlow

This project is designed to be easily moved to the same directory level as FibreFlow without breaking anything.

### When to Move
After initial setup and testing, you can move this directory to:
```
/home/ldp/VF/Apps/FF_React
```

### How to Move

1. **Simple Move Command**:
   ```bash
   # From /home/ldp/VF/Apps/FibreFlow directory
   mv FF_React ../FF_React
   ```

2. **Alternative (explicit paths)**:
   ```bash
   mv /home/ldp/VF/Apps/FibreFlow/FF_React /home/ldp/VF/Apps/FF_React
   ```

### Post-Move Checklist

1. **Reinstall Dependencies** (recommended):
   ```bash
   cd /home/ldp/VF/Apps/FF_React
   rm -rf node_modules
   npm install
   ```

2. **Update Git** (if initialized):
   ```bash
   # If you had git initialized, you might want to update remote URLs
   git remote -v  # Check current remotes
   ```

3. **Clear Build Cache**:
   ```bash
   rm -rf dist
   rm -rf .vite
   ```

4. **Update IDE/Editor**:
   - Close and reopen the project in your editor
   - VSCode: File → Open Folder → Select new location

### Why This Works

- ✅ **Relative Imports**: All imports use relative paths
- ✅ **No Hardcoded Paths**: No absolute paths in configuration
- ✅ **Self-Contained**: All dependencies are within the project
- ✅ **Build Tool**: Vite uses relative paths for all assets
- ✅ **TypeScript**: Paths are relative to tsconfig.json location

### What Won't Break

- Build process
- Development server
- TypeScript compilation
- Import statements
- Asset loading
- Environment variables
- Package.json scripts

### Development Can Continue

You can fully develop the application in the current location and move it at any time without issues. The move is simply changing the parent directory - all internal project structure remains intact.

## Best Practices Followed

1. **No Absolute Paths**: Everything uses relative paths
2. **Environment Variables**: For any external configurations
3. **Portable Configuration**: All config files use relative references
4. **Standard Structure**: Following typical React project conventions

## When NOT to Move

Don't move while:
- Development server is running
- Build process is active
- Git operations are in progress
- Node modules are being installed

Always stop all processes before moving the directory.
