# OneMap Status History Implementation - July 29, 2025

## Key Achievement
Implemented comprehensive status history tracking for OneMap imports. System now preserves complete audit trails instead of replacing status on each import.

## What Changed
- **Before**: Status was replaced on each import (no history)
- **After**: Status history preserved in array with date, agent, batch ID

## Scripts Created
- `bulk-import-history-fast.js` - Fast import with history tracking
- `generate-report-with-history.js` - Enhanced reporting
- `analyze-status-history.js` - Status analysis tool

## Current Status
- 1,292 properties imported with history tracking
- May 22-30 data shows no status changes (baseline established)
- System ready to capture future workflow progressions

## Quick Commands
```bash
# Process next CSV
node scripts/process-next-csv.js

# Generate report
node scripts/generate-report-with-history.js
```

## Business Value
- Complete audit trail for payment verification
- Track workflow bottlenecks
- Agent performance metrics
- Timeline analysis between status changes
