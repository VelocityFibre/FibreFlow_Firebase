# OneMap Quick Morning Workflow

## Instant Start Commands
When user says "process next CSV" or "onemap agent, process next":
1. **Immediate action**: Run `cd OneMap && node scripts/process-next-csv.js`
2. This script automatically finds and processes the next CSV in sequence

## Key Files to Check First
- `OneMap/CSV_PROCESSING_LOG.md` - Shows what's done and what's next
- `OneMap/QUICK_START.md` - Morning reference guide
- `OneMap/scripts/process-next-csv.js` - Smart auto-processor

## Current Processing Status (as of 2025-01-29)
- ‚úÖ May 22 - Completed
- ‚úÖ May 23 - Completed  
- üîÑ May 26 - Next to process
- ‚è≥ May 27, 29, 30 - Pending

## Skip These Time-Wasters
- Don't search for CSV files manually
- Don't check multiple directories
- Don't read long documentation
- Just run the smart processor!
