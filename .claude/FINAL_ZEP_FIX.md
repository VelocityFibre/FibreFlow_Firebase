# Zep SDK Issue Resolution

## Problem Identified
The Zep Cloud SDK v2.21.0 has a bug where the `memory.add()` method throws:
```
Error: Expected object. Received undefined.
```

This appears to be a JSON parsing issue in the SDK's response handling.

## Root Cause
- The API call likely succeeds (session creation works fine)
- The SDK expects a response object but receives undefined
- This is an internal SDK bug, not a configuration issue

## Workaround Solutions

### 1. Ignore the Error (Quick Fix)
Since session creation works, we can catch and ignore this specific error:

```javascript
try {
  await zep.memory.add({ sessionId, messages });
} catch (err) {
  if (err.message.includes('Expected object. Received undefined')) {
    // Ignore - SDK bug but operation likely succeeded
    console.log('Note: SDK returned an error but the memory was likely saved.');
  } else {
    throw err;
  }
}
```

### 2. Use Direct API Calls (Recommended)
Bypass the SDK and use the REST API directly:

```javascript
const axios = require('axios');

const api = axios.create({
  baseURL: 'https://api.getzep.com/api/v2',
  headers: {
    'Authorization': `Bearer ${apiKey}`,
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
  }
});

// This would work if we had the correct auth format
await api.post(`/sessions/${sessionId}/messages`, { messages });
```

### 3. Use Alternative Storage
Since we have a working local memory system, we can:
- Use local memory as primary storage
- Attempt Zep saves but don't block on errors
- Periodically retry failed saves

## Current Status
✅ **Sessions can be created successfully**
✅ **User authentication works**
❌ **Memory.add() has SDK bug**
✅ **Local memory system works perfectly**

## Recommendation
For now, use the local memory system as the primary storage and wait for:
1. SDK bug fix from Zep team
2. Official documentation on REST API auth format
3. Alternative SDK version that works

The local memory system provides all needed functionality:
- Conflict detection
- Category management
- Search capabilities
- Time-based queries
