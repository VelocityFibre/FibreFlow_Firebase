# Metrics Learning System

## Overview

The Metrics Learning System automatically processes objective data collected by the post_tool_use hook and generates actionable insights for improving Claude's future performance. This system bridges the gap between data collection and learning application.

## System Components

### 1. Data Collection (Already Implemented)
- **`post_tool_use.py`**: Hooks into every tool execution
- **Captures**: Performance metrics, error patterns, validation failures, success rates
- **Storage**: `.claude/logs/post_tool_use.json` and analytics snapshots

### 2. Metrics Processing (New)
- **`process_metrics_to_learnings.py`**: Deep analysis and pattern extraction
- **Analyzes**: Performance bottlenecks, error recovery, tool sequences, validation patterns
- **Outputs**: Machine-readable learnings and human reports

### 3. Context Integration (New)  
- **`integrate_with_context.py`**: Bridges learnings to context manager
- **Filters**: Only high-confidence learnings (≥60%)
- **Categorizes**: By type and impact level

### 4. Automation (New)
- **`run_metrics_learning.sh`**: Complete pipeline runner
- **`test_metrics_learning.py`**: System verification
- **Cron ready**: For periodic execution

## Quick Start

### Manual Execution
```bash
# Run complete analysis and integration
./.claude/scripts/run_metrics_learning.sh

# Or run components individually
python3 .claude/scripts/process_metrics_to_learnings.py
python3 .claude/scripts/integrate_with_context.py
```

### Automated Execution
```bash
# Add to crontab for every 6 hours
echo "0 */6 * * * $(pwd)/.claude/scripts/run_metrics_learning.sh" | crontab -

# Or daily at 2 AM
echo "0 2 * * * $(pwd)/.claude/scripts/run_metrics_learning.sh" | crontab -
```

### Testing
```bash
# Test with sample data
python3 .claude/scripts/test_metrics_learning.py
```

## Learning Types Generated

### 1. Performance Learnings
- **Consistently Slow Tools**: Tools regularly exceeding thresholds
- **High Variance Performance**: Unpredictable execution times
- **Bottleneck Identification**: Statistical analysis of performance patterns

Example:
```json
{
  "pattern": "WebFetch_consistently_slow",
  "description": "WebFetch operations are consistently slow with 75.0% taking >5s",
  "recommendation": "Consider: 1) Caching WebFetch results, 2) Batching operations, 3) Using alternative approaches"
}
```

### 2. Error Recovery Learnings
- **Recovery Patterns**: What tools typically follow specific errors
- **Success Sequences**: Which recovery approaches work best
- **Error Prevention**: Patterns that lead to fewer errors

Example:
```json
{
  "pattern": "FILE_NOT_FOUND_recovery",
  "description": "Common recovery pattern for FILE_NOT_FOUND errors", 
  "recommendation": "When encountering FILE_NOT_FOUND, consider using: LS → Glob → Read"
}
```

### 3. Workflow Learnings
- **Common Sequences**: Frequently used 3-7 tool workflows
- **Success Rate Analysis**: Which workflows succeed most often
- **Optimization Opportunities**: Workflows suitable for macros

Example:
```json
{
  "pattern": "workflow_5_tools",
  "description": "Common 5-tool workflow with 94.7% success rate",
  "recommendation": "This workflow is proven effective. Consider creating a macro or composite action."
}
```

### 4. Validation Learnings
- **Failure Patterns**: Common validation failure types and causes
- **Tool-Specific Issues**: Which tools commonly fail validation
- **Prevention Strategies**: Pre-validation checks to implement

### 5. Success Rate Learnings
- **Context Patterns**: What precedes successful operations
- **Tool Pairing**: Combinations that increase success rates
- **Improvement Metrics**: Quantified benefits of using patterns

## Output Files

### Machine-Readable Data
- **`extracted_learnings.json`**: Complete learnings with metadata
- **`tool_learnings.json`**: Formatted for context manager (from existing script)
- **`learning_runs.log`**: Execution history and status

### Human-Readable Reports
- **`metrics_analysis_report.md`**: Summary of patterns and recommendations
- **`tool_metrics_report.md`**: Basic metrics overview (from existing script)

## Integration Flow

```
Tool Usage Data → Metrics Collection → Pattern Analysis → Learning Extraction → Context Integration
     ↓                    ↓                   ↓                    ↓                  ↓
post_tool_use.py    analytics.json    process_metrics.py    learnings.json    context_manager
```

## Confidence Scoring

Learnings are scored based on:
- **Sample Size**: More data = higher confidence
- **Consistency**: Stable patterns score higher  
- **Statistical Significance**: Must exceed minimum thresholds
- **Impact**: High-impact patterns get confidence boosts

Confidence levels:
- **>80%**: High confidence - definitely actionable
- **60-80%**: Medium confidence - likely useful
- **<60%**: Low confidence - needs more data

## Impact Classification

- **High Impact**: Performance >5s, validation failures, success rates <80%
- **Medium Impact**: Performance 3-5s, recoverable errors, workflow optimizations  
- **Low Impact**: Minor improvements, edge cases

## Best Practices

### For Automated Runs
1. **Frequency**: Run daily or every 6 hours for fresh patterns
2. **Thresholds**: Adjust confidence thresholds based on your needs
3. **Storage**: Archive old learnings periodically
4. **Monitoring**: Check logs for integration success

### For Manual Analysis
1. **Focus on High Impact**: Prioritize high impact, high confidence learnings
2. **Implement Gradually**: Don't try to address all patterns at once
3. **Monitor Results**: Track if changes improve actual metrics
4. **Document Actions**: Note which recommendations you implement

## Customization

### Adjusting Thresholds
Edit `process_metrics_to_learnings.py`:
```python
# Performance thresholds
SLOW_THRESHOLD = 3000  # 3 seconds instead of 5
HIGH_VARIANCE_CV = 0.8  # Lower variance threshold

# Confidence requirements
MIN_SAMPLE_SIZE = 5    # Minimum operations needed
MIN_PATTERN_FREQUENCY = 3  # Minimum pattern occurrences
```

### Adding New Analysis Types
Extend the `MetricsAnalyzer` class:
```python
def analyze_custom_patterns(self, logs: List[Dict]) -> List[Learning]:
    """Add your custom analysis here"""
    # Your analysis logic
    return learnings
```

### Custom Categories
Modify the integration script to use custom categories:
```python
category = f"custom_{learning['type']}_{learning['impact']}"
```

## Troubleshooting

### No Learnings Generated
- Check data exists: `ls -la .claude/logs/post_tool_use.json`
- Verify sufficient operations (need >100 typically)
- Review confidence thresholds in script

### Integration Failures
- Ensure context_manager.py exists in parent directory
- Check Python path configuration
- Verify file permissions

### Low Confidence Scores
- Need more operations for statistical significance
- Patterns may be too varied
- Consider adjusting thresholds

Key benefits:
- **Objective**: Based on measured data, not subjective feedback
- **Automated**: Runs without manual intervention
- **Actionable**: Provides specific recommendations
- **Integrates**: Works with existing context management
- **Scalable**: Handles growing amounts of usage data
- **Measurable**: Success can be tracked through improved metrics
