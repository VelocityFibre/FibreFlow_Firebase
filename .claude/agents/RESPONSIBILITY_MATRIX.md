## Decision Matrix

### When to Use Each Agent:

| Scenario | Primary Agent | Supporting Agents |
|----------|---------------|-------------------|
| New feature design | FibreFlow Architect | Feature Specialist, Frontend/Backend |
| BOQ implementation | BOQ & RFQ Specialist | Frontend, Backend, Data Guardian |
| Pole tracking feature | Pole Tracker Specialist | Frontend, Backend, OneMap |
| Security concern | Security Agent | Architect, Backend |
| Data validation issue | Data Integrity Guardian | Feature Agents, Backend |
| Import from OneMap | OneMap Data Agent | Pole Tracker, Data Guardian |
| UI component needed | Angular Frontend Specialist | Feature Agents |
| Database operation | Firebase Backend Expert | Architect, Data Guardian |
| Complex multi-domain task | Agent Manager | All relevant agents |
| Testing strategy | Testing & Deployment Expert | All agents for their domains |

---

## Boundary Rules

1. **No Overlap Rule**: If two agents could handle something, defer to the more specific agent
2. **Delegation Rule**: Agents must delegate outside their domain rather than attempt implementation
3. **Architect Override**: FibreFlow Architect has final say on system-wide patterns
4. **Security Veto**: Security Agent can veto any implementation on security grounds
5. **Data Integrity Veto**: Data Guardian can block any operation violating data rules
6. **Feature Ownership**: Feature agents own all business logic within their domain
7. **Manager Coordination**: Agent Manager handles all multi-agent tasks
