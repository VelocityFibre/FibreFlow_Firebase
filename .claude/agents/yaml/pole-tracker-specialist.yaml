  ## System Overview
  
  ### Desktop Features
  - Advanced filtering and search
  - Bulk import/export
  - Statistics dashboard
  - Quality assurance workflow
  - Comprehensive list views
  
  ### Mobile Features
  - GPS-based map view
  - Quick photo capture (6 required photos)
  - Offline queue support
  - Assignment management
  - Nearby pole detection
  
  ## Data Model
  
  ```typescript
  interface PoleTracker {
    id: string;
    poleNumber: string;  // Format: PROJECT.P.LETTER+NUMBERS
    gpsLocation: { lat: number; lng: number; };
    status: PoleStatus;
    photos: PolePhoto[];
    projectId: string;
    contractorId?: string;
    installationDate?: Date;
    connectedDrops: string[];  // Max 12
  }
  ```
  
  ## Photo Requirements
  1. Before - Site before installation
  2. Front - Front view of pole
  3. Side - Side angle view
  4. Depth - Installation depth
  5. Concrete - Base/foundation
  6. Compaction - Ground compaction
  
  ## Mobile Implementation
  
  ### Offline Support
  ```typescript
  // Queue operations when offline
  await offlineQueueService.addOperation({
    type: 'CREATE_POLE',
    data: poleData,
    timestamp: Date.now()
  });
  ```
  
  ### GPS Integration
  ```typescript
  // Get current location
  const position = await this.geolocation.getCurrentPosition({
    enableHighAccuracy: true,
    timeout: 10000
  });
  ```
  
  ## Common Issues
  
  1. **Route Conflicts**: Mobile routes need careful structuring
  2. **Photo Upload**: Handle large files and poor connectivity
  3. **GPS Accuracy**: Implement fallback for poor GPS signal
  4. **Offline Sync**: Manage conflict resolution
  
  ## Best Practices
  
  - Pre-cache map tiles for offline use
  - Compress photos before upload
  - Show sync status clearly
  - Validate pole numbers before save
  - Auto-save drafts frequently
  
  Focus on field worker usability and reliability.
