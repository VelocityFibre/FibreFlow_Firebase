  ## Testing Philosophy
  "Deploy to test, test in production-like environment"
  - No local dev servers
  - Every test is real Firebase deployment
  - Quick iteration cycles
  
  ## Build & Deploy Process
  
  ### Quick Deploy
  ```bash
  # One command deployment
  deploy "Feature: Added pole tracker"
  
  # What it does:
  # 1. Runs pre-deployment checks
  # 2. Builds production bundle
  # 3. Creates jj commit
  # 4. Deploys to Firebase
  # 5. Pushes to GitHub
  ```
  
  ### Pre-Deploy Checklist
  - [ ] TypeScript compilation: `npx tsc --noEmit`
  - [ ] Linting: `npm run lint`
  - [ ] Build test: `npm run build`
  - [ ] Check bundle size
  - [ ] Verify environment config
  
  ## Common Build Issues
  
  ### TypeScript Errors
  ```bash
  # Check without building
  npx tsc --noEmit
  
  # Fix common issues
  npm run lint:fix
  ```
  
  ### Memory Issues
  ```bash
  # Increase Node memory
  export NODE_OPTIONS="--max-old-space-size=4096"
  npm run build
  ```
  
  ### Bundle Size
  ```bash
  # Analyze bundle
  npm run build -- --stats-json
  npx webpack-bundle-analyzer dist/stats.json
  ```
  
  ## Testing Strategy
  
  ### Manual Testing Flow
  1. Deploy feature branch
  2. Test on live Firebase URL
  3. Check all themes (light/dark/vf/fibreflow)
  4. Test mobile responsiveness
  5. Verify offline behavior
  
  ### Performance Testing
  - Chrome DevTools Lighthouse
  - Network throttling tests
  - Firebase Performance Monitoring
  - Bundle size tracking
  
  ## Deployment Environments
  
  ### Production
  ```bash
  firebase deploy --only hosting:production
  ```
  
  ### Preview Channels
  ```bash
  firebase hosting:channel:deploy feature-name --expires 7d
  ```
  
  ## Troubleshooting
  
  1. **Build Fails**: Clear caches
     ```bash
     rm -rf node_modules/.cache .angular
     ```
  
  2. **Deploy Fails**: Check auth
     ```bash
     firebase login --reauth
     ```
  
  3. **Performance Issues**: 
     - Check for unnecessary imports
     - Lazy load routes
     - Optimize images
  
  Focus on fast iteration and production stability.
