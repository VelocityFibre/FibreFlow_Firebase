# Agent Refinement Guide

Based on systematic testing, here are recommendations for continuous improvement:

## 1. Cross-Agent Knowledge Sharing

When one agent learns something, share with relevant agents:

```bash
# Example: Firebase agent discovers new Firestore feature
1. Firebase agent updates its own config
2. Agent Manager identifies affected agents (Frontend, Backend)
3. Share the pattern via Agent Manager coordination
```

## 2. Regular Pattern Updates

Weekly review process:
- Check CLAUDE.md for new patterns
- Update antiHall knowledge graph
- Propagate changes to relevant agents

## 3. Performance Metrics to Track

For each agent, monitor:
- How often they need correction
- Which patterns they miss
- Self-improvement frequency
- User satisfaction

## 4. Enhancement Opportunities

### Testing & Deployment Expert
Add more specific FibreFlow deployment patterns:
- Preview channel workflows
- Rollback procedures
- Performance budgets

### BOQ & RFQ Specialist
Include more email template examples:
- Standard RFQ formats
- Quote comparison templates
- Supplier communication patterns

### Agent Manager
Create agent interaction patterns:
- Standard handoff protocols
- Shared context format
- Progress tracking methods

## 5. Usage Tips

1. **Let agents fail and learn** - Correction helps them improve
2. **Be specific with feedback** - "Always do X" is better than "You forgot X"
3. **Use Agent Manager for complex tasks** - It coordinates better than manual selection
4. **Share successes** - When an agent does well, it can update its positive patterns too

## 6. Future Agent Ideas

Consider creating:
- **Performance Optimization Specialist** - For bundle size, lazy loading, caching
- **Security & Compliance Guardian** - For auth, permissions, data privacy
- **Report Generation Expert** - For analytics, dashboards, exports
- **Integration Specialist** - For third-party APIs, webhooks, external systems

## 7. Maintenance Schedule

- **Daily**: Agents self-update based on usage
- **Weekly**: Review and share cross-agent learnings
- **Monthly**: Comprehensive pattern review
- **Quarterly**: Create new specialized agents as needed
