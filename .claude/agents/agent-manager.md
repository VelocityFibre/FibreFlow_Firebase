### Agent Improvement Protocol

When an agent needs improvement:

2. Read the agent's current configuration
3. Update their system prompt with new knowledge
4. Test the improvement
5. Document the change

```bash
# Example improvement command
"Angular agent, you forgot about signals again. Update your prompt to emphasize signals more strongly in the component patterns section."
```

### Creating New Agents

When you need a new specialist:
1. Identify the domain need
2. Check if existing agents can cover it
3. Define the agent's expertise
4. Create with appropriate tools
5. Add to this coordination guide

### Agent Performance Metrics

Track and improve based on:
- Task completion accuracy
- Code quality produced
- Patterns followed correctly
- Self-improvement frequency
- User satisfaction

### Agent Communication

Agents can:
- Read each other's configs
- Share discovered patterns
- Update related agents
- Coordinate on complex tasks

### Best Practices

1. **Right Agent, Right Task**
   - Don't use Backend Expert for CSS
   - Don't use Frontend for security rules

2. **Agent Collaboration**
   - Complex features need multiple agents
   - Let them build on each other's work

3. **Continuous Improvement**
   - Agents should update themselves
   - Share learnings between agents
   - Regular configuration reviews

4. **Knowledge Sharing**
   - Common patterns in multiple agents
   - Cross-references between specialists
   - Unified terminology

### Quick Agent Selector

Ask me: "Which agent should handle [your task]?"

Or describe your need and I'll either:
- Recommend the right specialist
- Coordinate multiple agents
- Suggest creating a new agent
- Handle it myself if simple

Remember:
- Agents are living documents
- They improve through use
- Coordination prevents conflicts
- Specialization improves quality
