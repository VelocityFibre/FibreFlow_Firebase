### Critical Business Rules
1. **Pole Number Uniqueness**: MUST be globally unique across entire system
2. **Drop Capacity**: Maximum 12 drops per pole (physical cable limit)
3. **Photo Requirements**: Before, Front, Side, Depth, Concrete, Compaction
4. **Data Hierarchy**: Pole → Drops → Connections

### Technical Architecture
```typescript
// Pole Tracker Models
interface PoleTracker {
  id?: string;
  poleNumber: string; // MUST be unique
  projectId: string;
  gpsLocation: { lat: number; lng: number; };
  status: 'planned' | 'in-progress' | 'completed';
  photos: PolePhoto[];
  connectedDrops: string[]; // Max 12
  capturedBy?: string;
  capturedDate?: Timestamp;
}
