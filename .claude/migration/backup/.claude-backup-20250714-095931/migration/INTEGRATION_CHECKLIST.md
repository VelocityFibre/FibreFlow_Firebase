# SuperClaude Integration Checklist

## üéØ Goal
Integrate SuperClaude's structured workflows into FibreFlow's existing Claude configuration without breaking current functionality.

## ‚úÖ Pre-Integration Checklist

### Phase 1: Backup & Preparation
- [ ] Backup current .claude directory
- [ ] Backup CLAUDE.md
- [ ] Create jj snapshot for rollback
- [ ] Document current working commands
- [ ] Test antiHall integration still works

### Phase 2: Directory Structure
- [ ] Create .claude/shared/ directory
- [ ] Create .claude/commands/shared/ directory
- [ ] Create .claude/migration/ directory
- [ ] Create .claude/migration/backup/ directory
- [ ] Copy backups to migration/backup/

### Phase 3: Pattern Mapping
- [ ] Map current slash commands to SuperClaude equivalents
- [ ] Map CLAUDE.md rules to YAML workflows
- [ ] Map antiHall to SuperClaude MCP integration
- [ ] Identify FibreFlow-specific patterns to preserve
- [ ] Create fibreflow-workflows.yml

### Phase 4: Core Integration
- [ ] Install superclaude-core.yml (philosophy & standards)
- [ ] Install superclaude-personas.yml (adapted for Angular/Firebase)
- [ ] Install superclaude-mcp.yml (include antiHall)
- [ ] Install superclaude-rules.yml (merge with our rules)
- [ ] Create fibreflow-specific personas

### Phase 5: Command Migration
- [ ] Keep existing .md commands functional
- [ ] Add SuperClaude YAML commands in shared/
- [ ] Create hybrid commands that use both systems
- [ ] Test each command individually
- [ ] Document command usage

### Phase 6: Workflow Creation
- [ ] Convert "deploy" workflow to YAML
- [ ] Convert "create-feature" workflow to YAML
- [ ] Add FibreFlow-specific workflows
- [ ] Add security scanning workflow
- [ ] Add performance optimization workflow

### Phase 7: MCP Server Setup
- [ ] Configure antiHall as MCP server
- [ ] Add Context7 for documentation
- [ ] Add Sequential for complex analysis
- [ ] Test MCP integration
- [ ] Update settings.local.json

### Phase 8: Testing & Validation
- [ ] Test all existing commands still work
- [ ] Test new SuperClaude commands
- [ ] Test persona switching
- [ ] Test MCP servers
- [ ] Test with real FibreFlow feature

### Phase 9: Documentation
- [ ] Update CLAUDE.md with new capabilities
- [ ] Create SUPERCLAUDE_GUIDE.md
- [ ] Document persona usage
- [ ] Document workflow triggers
- [ ] Create quick reference

### Phase 10: Optimization
- [ ] Remove duplicate functionality
- [ ] Consolidate overlapping commands
- [ ] Optimize token usage with --uc
- [ ] Clean up unused files
- [ ] Final testing

## üìä Success Criteria
- [ ] All existing commands work
- [ ] New SuperClaude features accessible
- [ ] antiHall still validates patterns
- [ ] No breaking changes
- [ ] Improved AI guidance
- [ ] Reduced token usage

## üö® Rollback Plan
If issues occur:
1. `cd /home/ldp/VF/Apps/FibreFlow`
2. `rm -rf .claude`
3. `cp -r .claude/migration/backup/.claude-backup-* .claude`
4. `cp .claude/migration/backup/CLAUDE.md.backup CLAUDE.md`
5. `jj restore` (if using jj snapshot)

## üìù Notes
- Test after each phase
- Document any issues
- Keep FibreFlow patterns primary
- SuperClaude enhances, not replaces
