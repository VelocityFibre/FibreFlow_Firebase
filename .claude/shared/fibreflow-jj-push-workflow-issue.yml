# JJ (Jujutsu) Push Shows Nothing Changed
# Specific solution for jj git push issues
version: 1.0
name: JJ Push Nothing Changed Issue
description: Fix for when jj git push shows "Nothing changed" despite having commits

# Problem Details
problem:
  symptom: "jj git push shows 'Nothing changed'"
  cause: "Master bookmark not moved to current commit"
  confusion: "Commits exist but aren't being pushed"

# Understanding JJ Concepts
jj_concepts:
  bookmarks_vs_branches:
    - "JJ bookmarks = Git branches"
    - "Bookmarks don't move automatically"
    - "Must explicitly move bookmarks to commits"
  
  current_commit: "@ symbol represents current commit"
  master_bookmark: "Points to what will be pushed as 'master'"

# Complete Fix Workflow
solution_steps:
  1_check_current_state: |
    jj st           # See current commit
    jj log          # See commit history
    jj bookmark list # See where bookmarks point
  
  2_move_master_bookmark: |
    jj bookmark move master --to @
    # This moves 'master' to current commit (@)
  
  3_verify_bookmark_moved: |
    jj bookmark list
    # Should show: master: [commit-hash] (current commit)
  
  4_push_to_github: |
    jj git push --branch master
    # Now it will push successfully

# Common Scenarios
scenarios:
  after_new_commits:
    situation: "Made commits but master still points to old commit"
    fix: "jj bookmark move master --to @"
  
  multiple_bookmarks:
    situation: "Have feature branches"
    fix: "jj bookmark move feature-branch --to @"
  
  first_time_setup:
    situation: "No master bookmark exists"
    fix: "jj bookmark create master --to @"

# Visual Explanation
visual_guide: |
  Before moving bookmark:
  * @ (current) - "New feature implemented"
  * ◯ - "Previous commit"
  * ◯ master - "Old commit (nothing to push)"
  
  After moving bookmark:
  * @ master (current) - "New feature implemented" ✓
  * ◯ - "Previous commit"
  * ◯ - "Old commit"

# Complete Push Workflow
standard_workflow:
  1_make_changes: "Edit files"
  2_check_status: "jj st"
  3_describe_commit: "jj describe -m 'Your message'"
  4_move_bookmark: "jj bookmark move master --to @"
  5_push: "jj git push --branch master"

# Troubleshooting
if_still_not_working:
  check_remote: |
    jj git remote -v
    # Ensure remote is configured
  
  check_tracking: |
    jj bookmark list -r
    # See remote bookmarks
  
  force_push_carefully: |
    jj git push --branch master --force
    # Only if you're sure!

# Prevention
best_practices:
  - "Always move bookmark after commits"
  - "Check bookmark position before pushing"
  - "Use aliases for common workflows"

# Useful Aliases
suggested_aliases:
  push_master: |
    # Add to ~/.jjconfig.toml
    [alias]
    pm = ["bookmark", "move", "master", "--to", "@"]
    
    # Then use: jj pm && jj git push --branch master
