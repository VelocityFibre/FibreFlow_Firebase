  model_changes:
    project_model:
      location: "src/app/core/models/project.model.ts"
      additions:
        kpiTargets: 
          type: "Record<string, number>"

      key_methods:
        - "calculatePhases(project: Project): Phase[]"
        - "getDependencies(kpiType: string): string[]"
        - "calculateDuration(target: number, dailyRate: number): number"

# Business Logic & Rules
business_rules:
  kpi_types:
    trenching_km:
      dependencies: []
      can_start: "immediately"
      
    cables_km:
      dependencies: ["trenching_km"]
      can_start: "when trenching is 80% complete"
      
    blowing_km:
      dependencies: ["cables_km"]
      can_start: "when cables is 90% complete"
      
    splice_count:
      dependencies: []
      can_start: "parallel with other work"
      
    termination_count:
      dependencies: []
      can_start: "parallel with other work"
  
  timeline_rules:
    - "Weekends excluded from calculations"
    - "Dependencies create phase overlaps"
    - "Daily rates determine phase duration"
    - "Start dates cascade based on dependencies"

# Implementation Patterns
patterns_used:
  dependency_management:
    pattern: "Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)"
    implementation: |
      const dependencies = {
        'trenching_km': [],
        'cables_km': ['trenching_km'],
        'blowing_km': ['cables_km']
      };
    why: "Prevents circular dependencies, enables topological sorting"
  
  timeline_calculation:
    pattern: "Phase-based scheduling with overlaps"
    implementation: |
      // Calculate when dependent can start
      const startAfter = precedingPhase.duration * 0.8; // 80% complete
    why: "Realistic project scheduling, faster completion"
  
  progress_visualization:
    pattern: "Percentage-based with color coding"
    colors:
      - "0-30%: Red (#f44336)"
      - "31-70%: Orange (#ff9800)"  
      - "71-100%: Green (#4caf50)"
    why: "Instant visual feedback on performance"

# User Workflows
user_workflows:
  create_project_with_kpis:
    steps:
      1: "Navigate to /projects/new"
      2: "Fill project details"
      3: "Enter KPI targets (required):"
         - "Trenching (km)"
         - "Cable laying (km)"
         - "Cable blowing (km)"
         - "Splicing (count)"
         - "Termination (count)"
      4: "Set daily achievement rates"
      5: "Select project start date"
      6: "System shows calculated timeline"
      7: "Save project"
    
    validation:
      - "All KPI targets required"
      - "Daily rates must be positive"
      - "Start date cannot be in past"
  
  track_daily_progress:
    steps:
      1: "Go to daily progress entry"
      2: "Select project"
      3: "Enter today's achievements"
      4: "System updates progress indicators"
      5: "Timeline adjusts if needed"
    
    visual_feedback:
      - "Progress bars update in real-time"
      - "Percentage shows above bar"
      - "Color changes based on performance"
