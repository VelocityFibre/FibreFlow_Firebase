# Usage Instructions
usage:
  manual_selection: |
    # Explicitly set workflow
    !workflow new_feature
    !workflow bug_fix
    !workflow exploration
  
  automatic: |
    # System detects from task description
    "Create a new invoice feature" → new_feature workflow
    "Fix the BOQ import error" → bug_fix workflow
  
  query_current: |
    # Check active workflow
    !workflow status
    # Shows: Active workflow, loaded configs, current phase

# Workflow Metrics
metrics:
  track:
    - "Workflow switches per session"
    - "Most used workflows"
    - "Config load frequency"
    - "Conflict resolutions"
  
  optimize:
    - "Frequently paired configs"
