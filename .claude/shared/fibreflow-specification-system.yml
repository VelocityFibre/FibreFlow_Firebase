# FibreFlow Specification System
# Specifications as the primary artifact, code as implementation
version: 1.0
name: Specification-First Development
description: Define WHAT before HOW - specifications drive all development

# Core Philosophy
philosophy:
  principle: "Software engineering is about intent, not code"
  
  specification_first:
    - "Every feature starts with a specification"
    - "Code implements specifications, not ideas"
    - "Test against specifications, not just functionality"
    - "Specifications are versioned and tracked"
    - "AI generates code FROM specifications"

    !spec create {domain} "{title}"
    # Generates: SPEC-{DOMAIN}-{NEXT_NUMBER}
  
  implement_spec: |

    !spec implement SPEC-XXX-001
    # Loads spec, suggests approach, tracks progress
  
  validate_spec: |
    # Check implementation
    !spec validate SPEC-XXX-001
    # Runs tests, checks criteria
  
  list_specs: |
    # Show specifications
    !spec list {domain|status}
    # Shows filtered specification list

    - "Suggest spec updates from errors"
    - "Prevent specification drift"

# Migration Strategy
migration:
  existing_features:
    1: "Document current behavior as specs"
    2: "Identify missing specifications"
    3: "Create retroactive specs"
    4: "Link code to specs"
  
  new_features:
    1: "Always start with specification"
    2: "Get approval before coding"
    3: "Implement against spec"
    4: "Validate completion"

# Success Metrics
metrics:
  track:
    - "Features with specifications"
    - "Spec-to-implementation time"
    - "Spec violations found"
    - "Test coverage by spec"
  
  goals:
    - "100% new features have specs"
    - "Retroactive specs for core features"
    - "All tests linked to specs"
    - "Zero spec violations in production"
