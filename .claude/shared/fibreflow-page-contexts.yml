  # Offline Pole Capture - Simple Data Entry (DESIGN DECISION 2025-01-30)
  offline_pole_capture:
    design_philosophy: "Two-stage architecture: Simple offline capture + Backend processing"
    
    stage_1_simple_capture:
      purpose: "Fast, reliable field data entry - NO complex validation"
      route: "/offline-pole-capture"
      complexity: "LOW by design"
      storage_requirement: "50KB-500KB per device"
      what_it_does:
        - "Basic pole info capture (project, pole number, notes)"
        - "GPS coordinates with accuracy validation" 
        - "Required photos (before, front, side, depth, concrete, compaction)"
        - "Local offline storage queue"
        - "Simple search for continuing existing work"
        - "Auto-save drafts"
      what_it_does_NOT_do:
        - "❌ Complex pole number validation"
        - "❌ Duplicate checking across entire database"
        - "❌ Project-wide pole autocomplete" 
        - "❌ Heavy data synchronization"
        - "❌ Complex caching strategies"
    
    stage_2_backend_processing:
      purpose: "Heavy lifting, data validation, intelligent matching"
      location: "Firebase Functions + Database scripts"
      complexity: "HIGH but isolated from field agents"
      what_it_does:
        - "✅ GPS-to-pole matching algorithms"
        - "✅ Duplicate detection and resolution"
        - "✅ Data quality validation"
        - "✅ Automatic pole number assignment"
        - "✅ Cross-reference with existing pole databases"
        - "✅ Conflict resolution for multiple captures"
        - "✅ Data enrichment and standardization"
    
    benefits:
      for_field_agents:
        - "Fast: No waiting for data downloads"
        - "Reliable: Works offline, simple interface"
        - "Universal: Works on budget phones"
        - "Focused: Just capture data, no validation complexity"
        - "Low Storage: Minimal device requirements"
      for_management:
        - "High Quality: Backend ensures data integrity"
        - "Intelligent: GPS matching, duplicate resolution"
        - "Scalable: Heavy processing doesn't affect field ops"
        - "Flexible: Add algorithms without mobile app changes"
