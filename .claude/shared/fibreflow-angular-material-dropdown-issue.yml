# Angular Material Multi-Select Dropdown Solution
# Specific fix for dropdowns that don't close after selection
version: 1.0
name: Angular Material Dropdown Close Issue
description: Complete solution for mat-select multiple dropdowns that stay open

# Problem Description
problem:
  issue: "mat-select with multiple attribute doesn't close after selection"
  behavior: "Dropdown remains open allowing more selections (default Material behavior)"
  user_expectation: "Dropdown should close when user is done selecting"
  common_locations:
    - "Form selects with multiple options"
    - "Service/skill selection dropdowns"
    - "Tag/category pickers"

# Root Cause Analysis
root_cause:
  design_intent: "Angular Material multi-select is designed to stay open for multiple selections"
  technical_reason: "Material Design pattern for multi-selection UX"
  why_setTimeout_fails: "Race conditions with Angular change detection"
  why_openedChange_fails: "Event fires multiple times, timing dependent"

# The Solution Pattern
solution:
  approach: "Explicit Done button for user control"
  benefits:
    - "Clear user intent when finished selecting"
    - "No race conditions or timing issues"
    - "Follows Material Design explicit action pattern"
    - "Works consistently across all browsers"

# Implementation Template
implementation:
  html_template: |
    <mat-select formControlName="fieldName" multiple #selectRef>
      <mat-select-trigger>
        <mat-chip-set>
          <mat-chip *ngFor="let item of form.get('fieldName')?.value">
            {{ getItemLabel(item) }}
          </mat-chip>
        </mat-chip-set>
        <span *ngIf="!form.get('fieldName')?.value?.length">Select items...</span>
      </mat-select-trigger>
      
      <mat-option *ngFor="let option of options" [value]="option.value">
        {{ option.label }}
      </mat-option>
      
      <div class="dropdown-actions">
        <button mat-flat-button color="primary" type="button" (click)="closeDropdown()">
          Done
        </button>
      </div>
    </mat-select>

  typescript_method: |
    @ViewChild('selectRef') selectRef!: MatSelect;
    
    closeDropdown() {
      if (this.selectRef) {
        this.selectRef.close();
      }
    }

  css_styling: |
    .dropdown-actions {
      padding: 8px 16px;
      border-top: 1px solid #e0e0e0;
      background-color: #f9f9f9;
      display: flex;
      justify-content: flex-end;
      margin-top: 8px;
    }
    
    .dropdown-actions button {
      min-width: 80px;
      font-size: 14px;
    }

# What NOT to Do
avoid:
  - name: "setTimeout approaches"
    reason: "Race conditions with change detection"
    example: "setTimeout(() => this.select.close(), 100)"
  
  - name: "openedChange event handling"
    reason: "Event fires multiple times, unreliable"
    example: "(openedChange)=\"onOpenChange($event)\""
  
  - name: "FormControl valueChanges"
    reason: "Can cause unwanted closures during programmatic updates"
    example: "this.control.valueChanges.subscribe(() => this.close())"

# Reusable Pattern
reusable_pattern:
  when_to_use:
    - "Any mat-select with multiple attribute"
    - "User needs control over when selection is complete"
    - "Form UX requires explicit completion action"
  
  customizations:
    button_text: 
      - "Done" (recommended)
      - "Apply"
      - "Select" 
      - "OK"
    
    button_style:
      - "mat-flat-button color='primary'" (recommended)
      - "mat-button" (minimal)
      - "mat-raised-button" (elevated)
    
    positioning:
      - "Right aligned" (recommended)
      - "Center aligned"
      - "Left aligned with cancel option"
