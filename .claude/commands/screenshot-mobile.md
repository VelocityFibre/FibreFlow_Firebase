description: Take a mobile screenshot of PolePlantingApp for visual review
---

# Mobile Screenshot Command

This command quickly captures a screenshot of the PolePlantingApp in mobile viewport for immediate visual feedback during development.

## What I'll do:

1. **Launch the PolePlantingApp** in a mobile viewport (360x640)
2. **Navigate to the current page** you're working on
3. **Take a screenshot** and analyze it
4. **Check for common mobile issues**:
   - Touch target sizes
   - Text readability
   - Layout problems
   - Console errors

## Usage examples:

- `/screenshot-mobile` - Capture current state
- `/screenshot-mobile dashboard` - Capture specific page
- `/screenshot-mobile all` - Capture all main screens

## Mobile viewports I'll test:
- iPhone SE (375x667)
- Pixel 5 (393x851)
- iPhone 12 (390x844)
- Samsung Galaxy S20 (360x800)

I'll provide immediate feedback on any mobile usability issues I spot.
