      "summary": "Wasted 4 hours debugging wrong component. User was viewing action-items-grid but I was editing action-items-list. The clue 'Double-click cells to edit' only appears in grid view. Solution: Add ff-page-container wrapper. Lesson: Always verify actual component by checking unique text, using grep, or asking user if they see grid vs list view.",
