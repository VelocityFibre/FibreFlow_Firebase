## Integration with FibreFlow Workflow

### Complete Review Flow
```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Claude Code] -->|antiHall validates| B[Developer writes code]
    B --> C[Create PR]
    C --> D[CodeRabbit reviews]
    D --> E{Issues found?}
    E -->|Yes| F[Developer fixes]
    E -->|No| G[Human review]
    F --> D
    G --> H[Merge]
```

### Monthly Review
Check CodeRabbit dashboard for:
- Most common issues
- Review time savings
- Developer engagement
- False positive rate

## Troubleshooting

### CodeRabbit Not Reviewing
1. Check if installed on repository
2. Verify branch name matches config
3. Check GitHub Actions status
4. Review .coderabbit.yaml syntax

### Too Many Comments
1. Adjust review_profile to "balanced"
2. Add path exclusions
3. Configure specific rules

### Integration Issues
1. Check GitHub permissions
2. Verify webhook configuration
3. Contact CodeRabbit support

## Cost Management

### For FibreFlow
- **Start**: 14-day free trial
- **Evaluate**: Track metrics during trial
- **Decide**: Based on time savings and quality improvement
- **Optimize**: Start with Lite plan, upgrade if needed

### ROI Calculation
```
Time saved: 5 hours/week √ó 4 developers = 20 hours
Cost: $15-30/developer/month
Value: 20 hours √ó $100/hour = $2000/month saved
ROI: Very positive
```
