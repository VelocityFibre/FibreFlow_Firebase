## Data Model Gaps

### Missing Models:
1. **MasterMaterial** - Completely new
2. **ScopeOfWork** - Completely new
3. **Deliverable** - Completely new
4. **KPI** - Completely new
5. **PurchaseOrder** - Completely new
6. **PurchaseOrderItem** - Completely new

### Models Requiring Enhancement:
1. **StockItem** - Add UoM support, link to MasterMaterial
2. **BOQItem** - Link to MasterMaterial, add SOW reference
3. **Project** - Add SOW reference

## Technical Gaps

1. **Firebase Storage Integration** - For SOW document uploads
2. **Business Rules Engine** - For automated calculations
3. **Import/Export Enhancement** - Support for various material formats
4. **Notification System** - For low stock alerts
5. **Advanced Search** - For material selection with categories

## Process Gaps

1. **Material Standardization** - No current item code system
2. **Stock Reconciliation** - No formal process
3. **Procurement Workflow** - No defined approval process
4. **BOQ Generation** - No automation from SOW

## Integration Gaps

1. **BOQ-Stock Integration** - Currently separate systems
2. **Material-Supplier Link** - No current association
3. **Project-Procurement Link** - No visibility of orders per project
4. **SOW-BOQ Automation** - Manual process required

## Priority Implementation Order

### Critical (Week 1-2)
1. Master Material Registry with UoM
2. Enhanced Stock Model with UoM support
3. Material-Stock integration

### High Priority (Week 3-4)
1. SOW Management
2. BOQ-Material linking
3. Business rules for calculations
4. Shortage identification

### Medium Priority (Week 5-6)
1. Purchase Order module
2. Enhanced reporting
3. Import/Export improvements
4. Low stock alerts

### Low Priority (Week 7-8)
1. Advanced analytics
2. Supplier portal integration
3. Mobile app considerations
4. Audit trails

## Resource Requirements

### Development Team
- 2 Full-stack developers
- 1 UI/UX designer (part-time)
- 1 QA tester (part-time)

### Timeline
- 8 weeks for full implementation
- 2 weeks for testing and deployment
- 2 weeks for training and rollout

### Infrastructure
- Firebase Storage upgrade for documents
- Enhanced Firestore indexes
- Possible Cloud Functions for automation

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk
1. Data migration accuracy
2. User adoption of new workflows
3. Integration complexity

### Medium Risk
1. Performance with large datasets
2. Business rule accuracy
3. Training requirements

### Low Risk
1. Technical implementation
2. Firebase scalability
3. Security concerns

## Recommendations

1. **Start with Master Materials** - This is the foundation for everything else
2. **Implement UoM support early** - Critical for accurate tracking
3. **Focus on data quality** - Clean import of existing materials
4. **Incremental rollout** - Phase features to ensure stability
5. **User feedback loops** - Regular demos and adjustments

This gap analysis clearly shows that while FibreFlow has a solid foundation, significant development is needed to meet MPMS requirements, particularly around master materials, UoM support, and procurement functionality.
