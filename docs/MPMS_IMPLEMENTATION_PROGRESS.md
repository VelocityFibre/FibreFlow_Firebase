# MPMS (Material & Project Management System) Implementation Progress

## Overview
Implementing a comprehensive BOQ management module and material management system for FibreFlow.

## Implementation Plan Status

### Phase 1: Foundation (Weeks 1-2)
#### Week 1: Master Material Registry âœ… COMPLETED
- [x] Create Master Material model with UoM support
- [x] Build Material Service with CRUD operations
- [x] Create Material List component with search/filter
- [x] Create Material Form with validation
- [x] Implement CSV import/export for materials
- [x] Add remote logging for debugging
- [x] Fix save functionality (migrated from .toPromise() to firstValueFrom())
- [x] Fix list refresh mechanism (Subject-based refresh)
- [x] Fix Firestore query indexes

#### Week 2: Enhance Stock Module ðŸš§ IN PROGRESS
##### Day 1 (June 17, 2025) - COMPLETED
- [x] Update Stock model to link with Master Materials
  - Added materialDetails object to StockItem interface
  - Kept legacy fields for backward compatibility
- [x] Enhance Stock Service to enrich items with material data
  - Created enrichStockItemsWithMaterialData() method
  - Integrated material lookup in getStockItems() and getStockItemById()
- [x] Update Stock List UI to show linked materials
  - Added green link icon for linked items
  - Shows material name/description instead of stock fields when linked
  - Added tooltip showing linked material code

##### Day 2 (June 17, 2025) - PARTIALLY COMPLETED
- [x] Update Stock Form to include material autocomplete
  - Added material search autocomplete to Item Code field
  - Implemented auto-population of fields from selected material
  - Added mapping functions for category and UoM conversion
  - Added green link icon when material is selected
  - Fixed import paths for material service
  - Added CSS styling for autocomplete dropdown
- [ ] **NEEDS TESTING**: Material autocomplete functionality
- [ ] **NEEDS TESTING**: Auto-population of stock fields from material
- [ ] **NEEDS TESTING**: Visual indicators (green link icon)

##### Remaining Week 2 Tasks:
- [ ] Implement stock operations (receive, issue, transfer, adjust)
- [ ] Create stock movement tracking
- [ ] Add stock availability checks for BOQ
- [ ] Create stock reports and analytics

### Phase 2: Advanced Features (Weeks 3-4)
#### Week 3: SOW Management
- [ ] Create SOW model and service
- [ ] Build SOW CRUD interface
- [ ] Link SOW items to Master Materials
- [ ] Generate BOQ from SOW

#### Week 4: Enhanced BOQ Module
- [ ] Create comprehensive BOQ model
- [ ] Build BOQ management interface
- [ ] Implement BOQ templates
- [ ] Add BOQ revision tracking

### Phase 3: Integration (Weeks 5-6)
- [ ] Procurement module
- [ ] Supplier integration
- [ ] Purchase order generation
- [ ] Material allocation to projects

### Phase 4: Analytics & Optimization (Weeks 7-8)
- [ ] Reporting dashboards
- [ ] Predictive analytics
- [ ] Mobile optimization
- [ ] Performance tuning

## Current State Summary
1. **Master Materials Module**: âœ… Fully implemented and functional
2. **Stock-Material Integration**: ðŸš§ Implemented but needs testing
3. **Material Autocomplete**: ðŸš§ Implemented but needs testing

## Next Steps (For Tomorrow)
1. **Test Material Autocomplete**:
   - Create test materials
   - Test search functionality
   - Verify auto-population works correctly
   - Check visual indicators

2. **Fix Any Issues Found During Testing**

3. **Continue with Stock Operations**:
   - Implement receive/issue/transfer/adjust operations
   - Create stock movement dialog component
   - Update stock levels based on movements

## Key Concepts Implemented
- **Two-tier system**: Master Materials (catalog) vs Stock Items (inventory)
- **Backward compatibility**: Legacy stock items still work
- **Smart linking**: Stock items can optionally link to materials
- **Auto-enrichment**: Stock lists automatically show material data when available
- **UoM support**: Both unit-based and length-based materials

## Technical Notes
- Using Angular 17 with standalone components
- Firebase Firestore for database
- RxJS for reactive data flow
- Material Design components for UI
- Remote logging integrated for debugging

## Testing URLs
- Materials: https://fibreflow-73daf.web.app/materials
- Stock: https://fibreflow-73daf.web.app/stock

## Files Modified Today
1. `/src/app/features/stock/models/stock-item.model.ts`
2. `/src/app/features/stock/services/stock.service.ts`
3. `/src/app/features/stock/components/stock-list/stock-list.component.ts`
4. `/src/app/features/stock/components/stock-form/stock-form.component.ts`

## Known Issues
- Firebase deployment requires re-authentication
- Some SASS deprecation warnings (non-critical)
