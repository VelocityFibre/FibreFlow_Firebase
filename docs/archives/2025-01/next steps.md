  ðŸŽ¯ Connect Database EARLY (Phase 2-3)

  Why connect database early:
  1. Catch issues early - Firebase permissions, CORS, etc.
  2. Build with real data flow - Not just static UI
  3. Test the full stack - Frontend â†’ Firestore â†’ Frontend
  4. Avoid major refactoring - Building UI with real data is different from mocks

  ðŸ“‹ Revised Minimal Deployment Plan

  PHASE 1: Hello World (30 mins)

  - Basic Angular app
  - Deploy to Firebase Hosting
  - Verify deployment works

  PHASE 2: Firebase + Database (1 hour)

  - Add AngularFire
  - Connect to Firestore
  - Create ONE collection (e.g., "projects")
  - Display real data from Firestore
  - Deploy and verify

  PHASE 3: Auth + Security (1 hour)

  - Add Firebase Auth
  - Simple login
  - Firestore security rules
  - Deploy and verify

  PHASE 4: First Real Feature (Then build UI)

  - Create/Read/Update/Delete projects
  - With real Firestore operations
  - Then add Material UI
  - Deploy after each feature

  ðŸš€ Revised Task for Agent 1

  TASK: Create Minimal Angular + Firebase + Firestore App

  1. Create Angular project:
     ng new fibreflow-v2 --routing --style=scss --strict

  2. Add AngularFire:
     ng add @angular/fire
     - Select: Authentication, Firestore, Hosting

  3. Create simple app that:
     - Connects to Firestore
     - Reads from "projects" collection
     - Displays the data (even if empty)
     - Has one button to add a test project

  4. Set up Firebase project:
     - Enable Firestore
     - Set test mode security rules
     - Configure hosting

  5. Deploy and verify:
     - Data reads work
     - Can add a project
     - Everything works on live URL

  This proves the FULL STACK works before we build features!
