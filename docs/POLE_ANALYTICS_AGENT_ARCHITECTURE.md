# Pole Analytics Agent Architecture

## Overview

Hybrid approach combining traditional UI with AI agent processing for maximum flexibility and verification.

## Architecture Design

### 1. User Interface Layer (Keep Current Work)
- **Upload Interface**: User-friendly CSV upload
- **Configuration**: Date ranges, filters, options
- **Results Display**: Show generated reports
- **Export**: Download processed data

### 2. AI Agent Processing Layer (New)

#### Primary Agent: Data Analyst
```typescript
interface DataAnalystAgent {
  // Processes raw CSV data
  analyzeCSV(file: File, config: AnalysisConfig): Promise<AnalysisResult>;
  
  // Generates reports based on requirements
  generateReports(data: ParsedData, reportTypes: ReportType[]): Promise<Reports>;
  
  // Explains decisions and findings
  explainAnalysis(result: AnalysisResult): Promise<Explanation>;
}
```

#### Verification Agent: Quality Auditor
```typescript
interface QualityAuditorAgent {
  // Verifies primary agent's results
  verifyAnalysis(original: File, result: AnalysisResult): Promise<VerificationReport>;
  
  // Checks for data quality issues
  auditDataQuality(data: ParsedData): Promise<QualityReport>;
  
  // Validates business rules
  validateBusinessRules(result: AnalysisResult): Promise<ValidationReport>;
}
```

### 3. Integration Architecture

```

                                      ‚Üì

                            Combined Results ‚Üí UI Display
```

## Agent Prompts Structure

### Primary Agent System Prompt
```
You are a data analyst specializing in pole permission tracking.
Your task is to process OneMap CSV data and generate analytical reports.

Key responsibilities:
1. Parse CSV with 17 required columns
2. Filter for "Pole Permission: Approved" status
3. Remove duplicates by pole number (keep earliest)
4. Validate agent assignments
5. Generate time-based reports (monthly/weekly)
6. Provide data quality metrics

Always explain your reasoning and highlight any anomalies found.
```

### Verification Agent System Prompt
```
You are a quality auditor verifying data analysis results.
Your role is to ensure accuracy and catch any errors.

Verification tasks:
1. Recalculate key metrics independently
2. Spot-check random samples
3. Verify business rule compliance
4. Identify discrepancies
5. Rate confidence level (0-100%)

Be skeptical and thorough. Question unusual patterns.
```

## Benefits Over Pure Code Solution

1. **Adaptability**: Handles CSV format variations
2. **Intelligence**: Detects anomalies humans might miss
3. **Explanation**: Can explain why decisions were made
4. **Verification**: Built-in double-checking
5. **Evolution**: Improves with feedback

## Integration with Existing Work

### Keep These Components:
- PoleAnalyticsComponent (main UI)
- Models (for TypeScript typing)
- Routing structure
- Export functionality

### Replace These With Agents:
- CSV parsing logic
- Data filtering algorithms  
- Duplicate detection
- Report generation logic

### New Components Needed:
- AgentOrchestratorService
- PromptTemplateService
- ResultFormatterService
- VerificationDisplayComponent

## Cost-Benefit Analysis

### Benefits:
- üöÄ Faster adaptation to new requirements
- üéØ Higher accuracy through verification
- üß† Intelligent anomaly detection
- üìä Natural language report customization
- üîÑ Easy CSV-to-API transition

### Considerations:
- üí∞ API costs (~ $0.01-0.05 per analysis)
- ‚è±Ô∏è Slightly slower processing (5-10 seconds)
- üîå Requires internet connection
- üîê Data privacy considerations

## Recommended Next Steps

1. **Pause current code implementation**
2. **Build proof-of-concept agent**
3. **Test with sample data**
4. **Compare results with manual analysis**
5. **Make go/no-go decision**

## Conclusion

The agent approach offers significant long-term benefits for:
- Handling evolving requirements
- Ensuring data quality through verification
- Providing explanatory analytics
- Reducing maintenance burden

This aligns with modern AI-assisted development patterns and provides a more robust, adaptable solution.
