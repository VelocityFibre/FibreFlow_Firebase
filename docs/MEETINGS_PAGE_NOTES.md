# Meetings Page Notes

## 2025-07-08 - Meetings Page Investigation and Configuration

### Current Status
- Meetings page is functional but using mock data
- Fireflies API integration is implemented but not configured
- API key found in `.env.local`: `894886b5-b232-4319-95c7-1296782e9ea6`

### Tasks in Progress
1. Configure Fireflies API key in Firebase Functions
2. Remove authentication requirement from Fireflies API calls
3. Remove mock data fallback from meetings page
4. Investigate submodule issue

### Configuration Required
```bash
# Firebase Functions config command (not yet executed)
firebase functions:config:set fireflies.api_key="894886b5-b232-4319-95c7-1296782e9ea6"
```

### Issues Found
1. **API Key Configuration**: ✅ FIXED - Set in Firebase Functions config
2. **Authentication**: ✅ FIXED - Removed auth requirement from Firebase Functions
3. **Mock Data**: ✅ FIXED - Removed mock data fallback
4. **Submodule Issue**: ✅ FIXED - Removed FibreFlow-Meetings directory which was causing confusion. It contained no source code and was not a proper git submodule. All meetings functionality is properly located in src/app/features/meetings/

### Next Steps
- Deploy Firebase Functions with the new configuration:
  ```bash
  firebase deploy --only functions
  ```
- Test the meeting sync functionality
