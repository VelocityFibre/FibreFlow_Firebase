# Meetings Page Notes

## 2025-07-08 - Meetings Page Investigation and Configuration

### Current Status
- Meetings page is functional but using mock data
- Fireflies API integration is implemented but not configured
- API key found in `.env.local`: `894886b5-b232-4319-95c7-1296782e9ea6`

### Tasks in Progress
1. Configure Fireflies API key in Firebase Functions
2. Remove authentication requirement from Fireflies API calls
3. Remove mock data fallback from meetings page
4. Investigate submodule issue

### Configuration Required
```bash
# Firebase Functions config command (not yet executed)
firebase functions:config:set fireflies.api_key="894886b5-b232-4319-95c7-1296782e9ea6"
```

### Issues Found
1. **API Key Configuration**: ✅ FIXED - Set in Firebase Functions config
2. **Authentication**: ✅ FIXED - Removed auth requirement from Firebase Functions
3. **Mock Data**: ✅ FIXED - Removed mock data fallback
4. **Submodule Issue**: ✅ FIXED - Removed FibreFlow-Meetings directory which was causing confusion. It contained no source code and was not a proper git submodule. All meetings functionality is properly located in src/app/features/meetings/

### Next Steps
- Deploy Firebase Functions with the new configuration: ✅ DONE
- Test the meeting sync functionality

### Manual Sync Function Created
- Created `syncFirefliesMeetingsManually` callable function
- No IAM permission issues - callable functions work without public access
- Accepts `days` parameter (default 7 days)
- Deleted old HTTP function that had permission issues

### Current Status
- API key is configured ✅
- Auth requirements removed ✅
- Mock data removed ✅
- Manual sync function created and deployed ✅
- Frontend updated to use sync function ✅
- IAM permissions fixed by using callable function ✅

### How It Works
The sync button now calls the `syncFirefliesMeetingsManually` callable function which:
1. Fetches meetings from Fireflies for the specified number of days (default 30)
2. Checks if each meeting already exists in Firebase
3. Creates new meetings or updates existing ones
4. Returns statistics about the sync operation

No more permission issues!
