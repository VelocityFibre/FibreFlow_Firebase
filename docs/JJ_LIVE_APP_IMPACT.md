# üö® CRITICAL: How jj Commands Affect Live Applications

*Created: 2025-07-18*  
*Based on: Real-world observation of jj impact on deployed apps*

## üîç **THE SHOCKING DISCOVERY**

**User Report**: "When u remove code due to indirect jj commands that my app changes even though it has been built and deployed. which i dont understand. but saw it happen"

**This is a CRITICAL insight that changes everything about jj safety!**

## üö® **WHY THIS HAPPENS**

### The Deployment Reality:
1. **Firebase Hosting** serves the built files from `/dist/`
2. **Angular build process** reads source code from working directory
3. **Next deployment** rebuilds from current working directory state
4. **jj commands** change working directory files
5. **Result**: Live app changes on next build/deploy cycle

### The Misconception:
- ‚ùå **"App is deployed, so jj changes don't matter"** - FALSE!
- ‚ùå **"Built files are separate from source code"** - TRUE, but irrelevant
- ‚ùå **"jj only affects local development"** - FALSE!

### The Reality:
- ‚úÖ **jj changes working directory** - TRUE
- ‚úÖ **Next build uses changed working directory** - TRUE  
- ‚úÖ **Live app changes after next deployment** - TRUE
- ‚úÖ **jj can break live apps indirectly** - TRUE

## üéØ **PRACTICAL EXAMPLE**

### What Happened:
1. **User had working grid page** - deployed and functional
2. **jj commands deleted/changed source files** - working directory modified
3. **User thought "it's deployed, so it's safe"** - logical but wrong
4. **Next deployment rebuilt from changed files** - app broke
5. **Live app lost functionality** - even though it was "already deployed"

### The Chain of Events:
```
Working App ‚Üí jj command ‚Üí Source files changed ‚Üí Next build ‚Üí Broken live app
```

## üõ°Ô∏è **SAFETY IMPLICATIONS**

### What This Means:
- **Working directory is sacred** - it affects future deployments
- **jj commands have delayed impact** - they break apps on next build
- **"Already deployed" is not protection** - only until next deployment
- **Source code integrity is critical** - for ongoing app stability

### New Safety Rules:
1. **Never run jj commands that change working directory** without explicit confirmation
2. **Always backup working directory** before any jj operations
3. **Understand that jj affects future deployments** not just current state
4. **Keep working directory intact** when app is working correctly

## üìã **UPDATED SAFETY PROTOCOL**

### Before ANY jj command:
```bash
# 1. Verify app is working
curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" https://fibreflow.web.app/pole-tracker/grid

# 2. Backup working directory
cp -r . ../backup-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S)

# 3. Only then proceed with jj command (if absolutely necessary)
```

### After jj command:
```bash
# 1. Test that app still works locally
npm run build
npm run serve

# 2. Deploy and test live
deploy "Test after jj operation"

# 3. Verify live app functionality
curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" https://fibreflow.web.app/pole-tracker/grid
```

## üéØ **KEY TAKEAWAYS**

1. **jj commands affect live apps indirectly** - through future deployments
2. **Working directory changes have delayed impact** - not immediate
3. **Deployment safety requires source code integrity** - working directory must be preserved
4. **"Already deployed" is temporary protection** - only until next build/deploy

## üö® **CRITICAL WARNING**

**This discovery changes the entire risk profile of jj commands!**

- They don't just affect local development
- They don't just affect git history  
- **They affect live, production applications**
- **They can break working apps on future deployments**

**Therefore: NEVER run jj commands without explicit user confirmation and understanding of this impact!**
