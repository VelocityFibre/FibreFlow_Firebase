## Weekly Report Generation Plan (Added 2025-07-08)

### Overview
Generate professional weekly reports from FibreFlow KPIs data that match the Velocity Fibre report format (similar to "Velocity Fibre Weekly Report - Lawley 16-22 June").

### Phase 1: Data Collection Enhancement

#### 1.1 Add Missing Fields to KPIs Enhanced Form
**Target Page**: https://fibreflow-73daf.web.app/daily-progress/kpis-enhanced

**New Fields Required:**
1. **Customer Engagement Section** (add to Financial tab or create new tab):
   - Home sign-ups (number input)
   - Home drops completed (number input)
   - Home connections (number input)
   
2. **Operational Status Section** (add to Comments tab):
   - Missing status count (number input)
   - Site live status (dropdown: "Not Live", "Partially Live", "Fully Live")

#### 1.2 Data Model Extensions

  homeSignUps?: number;
  homeDropsCompleted?: number;
  homeConnections?: number;
  missingStatusCount?: number;
  siteLiveStatus?: 'Not Live' | 'Partially Live' | 'Fully Live';
}
```

### Phase 2: Report Generation Service

#### 2.1 Create Weekly Report Service
- Query 7 days of KPI data
- Calculate weekly totals and daily breakdowns
- Identify high-performance days
- Analyze patterns and operational gaps
- Generate executive summaries

#### 2.2 Report Structure (VF Format)

2. **Executive Summary**: Key achievements, critical focus areas
3. **Performance Metrics Summary**:
   - Infrastructure Development (poles planted)
   - Permissions Processing
   - Stringing Operations (by cable type)
   - Customer Engagement (new fields)
4. **Daily Performance Analysis**
5. **Risk Assessment & Recommendations**

### Phase 3: Document Generation

```

#### 3.2 Implementation

- Downloads as `VF_Weekly_Report_[Project]_[DateRange].docx`

### Timeline Estimate
- Phase 1: 2-3 hours (enhance KPIs form)
- Phase 2: 3-4 hours (service development)
- Phase 3: 4-5 hours (document generation)
- Phase 4: 2-3 hours (UI integration)

### Implementation Complete
All phases of the weekly report generation feature have been implemented and are ready for testing.

### Issue Investigation (2025-07-08)
- **Problem**: Weekly report generation shows "Generating weekly report..." message but doesn't download the DOCX file
- **Finding**: A report entry appears in the Reports page with a spinning loading icon
- **Root Cause Analysis**:
  1. There are two different `generateWeeklyReport` methods in the codebase:
     - `report.service.ts`: Saves reports to Firestore database (creates the Reports page entry)
     - `weekly-report-generator.service.ts`: Our new service that generates data for DOCX export
  2. The report generation is working correctly (data is being generated)
  3. The DOCX file is being created (blob generation succeeds)
  4. The download trigger appears to be blocked or intercepted

### Enhanced Logging Added
- Added detailed console logging throughout the generation process
- Added blob size logging to confirm file creation
- Added alternative download method as fallback
- Added better error handling for DOCX generation

### Next Steps for User
1. **Deploy the enhanced logging version**: Firebase authentication needs to be refreshed
   ```bash
   firebase login --reauth
   npm run deploy
   ```

2. **Test again and check console logs** for:
   - "WeeklyReportDocxService.generateReport called with:" (should show report data)
   - "Blob created:" and "Blob size:" (confirms DOCX generation)
   - "saveAs called" or "Alternative download method" messages
   - Any error messages

3. **Possible solutions**:
   - Check browser popup blocker settings
   - Try in an incognito window
   - Check if any browser extensions are blocking downloads
   - Consider adding a direct download link instead of auto-download
