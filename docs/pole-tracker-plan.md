# Pole Tracker Feature Development Plan

## Overview
The Pole Tracker is a comprehensive system for tracking fiber optic pole installations, including photo documentation, quality checks, and progress monitoring.

## Pole ID System
- **VF Pole ID Format**: `LAW.P.A001`
  - `LAW` = Project code (auto-generated from project code or first 3 letters)
  - `P` = Pole indicator
  - `A001` = Sequential number per project

## Phase 1: MVP (Basic Functionality)
**Timeline: Current Sprint**

### 1.1 Data Model
- Core pole tracking fields (ID, project, location, type, contractor, team)
- 5 image upload types (front, side, depth, concrete, compaction)
- Basic quality check functionality
- Metadata tracking (created/updated timestamps and users)

### 1.2 Features
1. **Pole List View**
   - Table with sortable columns
   - Filter by project, contractor, date range
   - Search by pole ID
   - Upload status indicators

2. **Add/Edit Pole Form**
   - Auto-generate VF Pole ID
   - Project selection (dropdown)
   - Installation date picker
   - Location field (GPS/address)
   - Pole type selection
   - Contractor and team dropdowns
   - 5 image upload sections

3. **Image Upload System**
   - Accept JPEG/PNG formats
   - Auto-compress images >2MB
   - Generate thumbnails
   - Progress indicators
   - Store image metadata (GPS, size)

4. **Quality Check**
   - Simple checkbox system
   - Track who checked and when
   - Optional notes field

### 1.3 Technical Implementation
- **Models**: `pole-tracker.model.ts`
- **Service**: `pole-tracker.service.ts` with Firestore integration
- **Components**:
  - `pole-tracker-list.component.ts`
  - `pole-tracker-form.component.ts`
  - `image-upload.component.ts`
- **Routes**: Under `/projects` as "Pole Tracker"

## Phase 2: Enhanced Features
**Timeline: Next Sprint**

  - Mobile-first form layout
  - Touch-friendly controls
  - Optimized for field use

- **Camera Integration**
  - Direct camera access
  - Auto-capture GPS from device
  - Batch photo capture

### 2.2 Progress Tracking
- **Dashboard Widget**
  - Poles installed vs. total expected
  - Progress bars by project
  - Daily/weekly installation rates

- **Reports**
  - Filter by contractor/team/date
  - Export capabilities
  - Performance metrics

### 2.3 Bulk Operations
- **CSV Import**
  - Template download
  - Validation rules
  - Error reporting
  - Bulk pole creation

- **Batch Updates**
  - Multi-select in list view
  - Bulk status changes
  - Group quality checks

## Phase 3: Advanced Features
**Timeline: Future Release**

### 3.1 Map Visualization
- **Interactive Map**
  - Google Maps integration
  - Pole location markers
  - Cluster view for density
  - Filter by status/project
  - Route visualization

### 3.2 Stock Integration
- **Material Tracking**
  - Link poles to inventory
  - Auto-deduct from stock
  - Track pole types used
  - Low stock alerts

### 3.3 Advanced Analytics
- **Dashboards**
  - Installation timeline charts
  - Contractor performance metrics
  - Cost analysis
  - Predictive completion dates

- **Export Options**
  - PDF reports with images
  - Excel exports
  - API integration

## Navigation & Integration

### Menu Structure
```
Projects
├── Project List
├── Pole Tracker (NEW)
├── Daily Progress
└── ...
```

### Integration Points
1. **Projects**: Poles linked to specific projects
2. **Contractors**: Dropdown populated from contractors module
3. **Staff**: Quality checkers from staff list
4. **Daily Progress**: Pole installation counts feed into progress
5. **Stock**: Future integration for material tracking

## Mobile Upload Flow
1. Field worker opens mobile view
2. Selects project and enters basic info
3. Takes photos directly from camera
4. App auto-compresses and uploads
5. GPS automatically captured
6. Works offline with queue sync

## Quality Assurance Process
1. All images uploaded → Auto-flag for QA
2. QA staff reviews images
3. Marks as quality checked
4. Optional: Request re-uploads
5. Track QA completion rates

## Security & Permissions
- **Field Workers**: Can create and upload
- **QA Staff**: Can review and approve
- **Managers**: Full access plus reports
- **Admins**: System configuration

## Performance Considerations
- Image compression on client-side
- Lazy loading for image galleries
- Pagination for large pole lists
- Indexed queries for fast filtering
- CDN for image delivery

## Future Enhancements
- AI-powered image validation
- Automatic defect detection
- Integration with GIS systems
- Real-time progress notifications
- Predictive analytics for delays
