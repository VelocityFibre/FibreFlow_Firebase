# Agent Fix Summary - 2025-01-18

## What Was Fixed

### Issue: Firebase Callable Functions CORS Error
The agent was failing to call Firebase Functions due to a response format mismatch.

### Root Cause
The Angular service was expecting Firebase callable function responses to be wrapped in a `.data` property, but the functions return data directly.

### Fix Applied
Updated `/src/app/core/services/agent-chat.service.ts` to handle both response formats:
```typescript
// Before: expecting result.data.response
// After: handling both result.data and result directly
const responseData = result.data || result;
```

## Current Status

✅ **Angular app fixed** - Now properly handles Firebase Function responses  
✅ **Firebase Functions deployed** - All agent functions are active  
✅ **Fallback mechanism** - If Firebase fails, falls back to direct Anthropic API  

## How to Test

1. **Open FibreFlow**: https://fibreflow-73daf.web.app
2. **Open Dev Panel**: Bottom right corner icon
3. **Try these queries**:
   - "How many poles for lawley?"
   - "What projects do we have?"
   - "Show me pole status for Law-001"

## Expected Behavior

When you ask about "lawley" or "Law-001":
1. Agent should detect the project code
2. Query Firebase for actual data
3. Return real pole counts from database
4. Store conversation in memory

## What to Watch For

### Success Indicators:
- No CORS errors in console
- Agent responds with actual data (not generic responses)
- Console shows "Firebase agent callable response"
- Responses mention specific numbers from database

### If Still Failing:
- Check browser console for errors
- Look for "Firebase agent callable error" messages
- Verify Anthropic API is not overloaded (529 errors)

## Architecture Reminder

```
User → Dev Panel → AgentChatService → Firebase Function (agentChat)
                                            ↓
                                     Intent Analyzer
                                            ↓
                                     Context Builder (queries Firestore)
                                            ↓
                                     Anthropic API (generates response)
                                            ↓
                                     Memory Service (stores conversation)
```

## Next Steps If Working

1. Ask various questions to train the agent
2. Check memory persistence across sessions
3. Verify project code detection works
4. Test contractor and pole queries

## Troubleshooting

If agent still gives generic responses:
- The Anthropic API key might not be configured in Firebase
- The project query in context-builder.js might not find data
- Check Firebase Functions logs for detailed errors

Remember: The agent should now be querying real Firebase data, not making up numbers!
