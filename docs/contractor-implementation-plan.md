### Firestore Collections
1. `contractors` - Main contractor registry
2. `contractorAssignments` - Project assignments
3. `contractorMilestones` - Payment milestones
4. `contractorPerformance` - Performance metrics
5. `contractorOnboarding` - Onboarding workflow state

### Integration Points

- **Notifications**: For alerts and approvals

## Success Criteria
- Contractors can be added and managed efficiently
- Project managers can assign contractors with clear targets
- Payments are processed based on achievement
- Performance is tracked and visible
- System reduces manual contractor management by 80%

## Timeline
