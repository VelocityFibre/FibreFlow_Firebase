# SOW (Scope of Work) Module Strategy

## Overview
The SOW module manages the import and validation of fiber optic infrastructure data from Excel files into the FibreFlow system. This data represents the initial scope of work for a project, including poles, drops (home connections), and fiber cable segments.

## Strategic Decision: Neon as Primary Data Store

### Decision Summary
After extensive analysis and discussion, we've chosen to use **Neon (PostgreSQL) as the primary data store** for SOW data, with the Firebase app querying and displaying this data directly.

### Key Reasons
1. **SOW Nature**: Static infrastructure data imported once at project setup
2. **Data Volume**: Thousands of records better suited to SQL databases
3. **Analytics**: Complex queries and reporting easier in PostgreSQL
4. **OneMap Integration**: Status updates already flow through Neon
5. **Simplicity**: No complex Firebase-Neon sync logic needed

## Data Architecture

### Data Flow
```
Initial Import:
Excel Files → SOW Import Wizard → Validation → Neon Database

Ongoing Updates:
1MapData → Excel → OneMap → Neon (status updates)

Display in App:
Firebase App → Query Service → Neon → Display Components
```

### Storage Strategy
- **Neon**: Master data storage for all SOW records
- **Firebase**: Project metadata, user data, real-time features
- **Mixed Queries**: Components can pull from both sources

## Import Process Design

### Single-File Sequential Import
Changed from multi-file to single-file import for better control:

1. **Poles Import**
   - User selects poles Excel file
   - System validates structure and data
   - Shows validation results
   - User confirms to proceed

2. **Drops Import**
   - User selects drops Excel file
   - System validates and checks pole references
   - Shows validation results
   - User confirms to proceed

3. **Fibre Import** (Optional)
   - User selects fibre Excel file
   - System validates cable segments
   - Shows validation results
   - User confirms to proceed

4. **Final Review**
   - Display complete import summary
   - Show all validation results
   - Require explicit acceptance
   - Only then write to Neon

### Validation Strategy
- **Per-File Validation**: Check each file independently
- **Cross-File Validation**: Verify references after all imports
- **Data Integrity**: Enforce unique IDs, valid references
- **User Feedback**: Clear error messages with row numbers

## Implementation Approach

### Phase 1: Import Wizard Update
- Convert to single-file import flow
- Add file-specific validation rules
- Implement staged confirmation process
- Create final review screen

### Phase 2: Neon Integration
- Design database schema
- Create connection service
- Implement data write operations
- Add error handling and rollback

### Phase 3: Display Integration
- Create Neon query service
- Update components to display SOW data
- Implement caching for performance
- Handle loading and error states

## Benefits of This Architecture

1. **Performance**
   - PostgreSQL handles large datasets efficiently
   - No Firebase document size limits
   - Optimized queries with indexes

2. **Simplicity**
   - Single source of truth
   - No sync complexity
   - Direct queries when needed

3. **Flexibility**
   - Can update directly in Neon
   - Can run complex analytics
   - Can integrate with other systems

4. **Maintainability**
   - Clear data flow
   - Easier debugging
   - Standard SQL knowledge applies

## Risk Mitigation

| Risk | Mitigation Strategy |
|------|---------------------|
| Network latency | Implement caching layer |
| Connection failures | Retry logic with exponential backoff |
| Data corruption | Transaction-based imports with rollback |
| Query performance | Create optimized indexes and views |

## Future Enhancements

1. **Bulk Operations**
   - Update multiple records efficiently
   - Batch status changes
   - Mass reassignments

2. **Advanced Analytics**
   - Progress tracking queries
   - Resource utilization reports
   - Predictive analytics

3. **API Integration**
   - Direct API import (skip Excel)
   - Real-time status webhooks
   - Third-party integrations

## Conclusion

This Neon-first architecture provides the optimal solution for SOW data management. It leverages the strengths of both Firebase (real-time, mobile) and Neon (analytics, bulk data) while maintaining simplicity and performance.

The single-file import process ensures data quality while the direct query approach eliminates synchronization complexity. This foundation supports both current needs and future growth.
