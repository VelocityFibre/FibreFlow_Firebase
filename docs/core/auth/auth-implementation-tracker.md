## Progress Notes

### 2025-01-12 - Day 1
- **10:00 AM**: Started implementation
- **10:05 AM**: Created user profile model with comprehensive permissions matrix
  - Defined 5 user groups: admin, project-manager, technician, supplier, client
  - Each group has specific permissions for different operations
  - Added optional fields for phone, company, lastLogin
- **10:15 AM**: Created auth service with mock mode
  - Mock user always logged in as admin
  - Observable streams for user state management
  - Helper methods for role checking
- **10:20 AM**: Created login component
  - Professional UI with Google sign-in button
  - Shows development mode notice
  - Responsive design with error handling
- **10:25 AM**: Created auth guards
  - Both guards always return true in dev mode
  - Production code commented but ready to enable
  - Console logging shows what would happen in production
- **10:30 AM**: Created test auth component
  - Available at `/test-auth` route
  - Shows current user and permissions
  - Allows switching between user groups for testing
  - Real-time permission updates

### Day 1 Summary
‚úÖ **All Day 1 tasks completed successfully!**
- Auth system is fully mocked and working
- No interference with existing project code
- Ready to test different user groups and permissions
- Foundation ready for Day 2 permission system implementation

### Next Steps (Day 2)
1. Create permission service for fine-grained access control
2. Add permission directives for showing/hiding UI elements
3. Create user management component for admins

---

## Testing Plan

### Mock User for Development
```typescript
{
  uid: 'dev-user',
  email: 'dev@test.com',
  displayName: 'Dev User',
  userGroup: 'admin',
  isActive: true,
  createdAt: new Date()
}
```

### Test Scenarios
- [ ] Login with Google (mock)
- [ ] Check user permissions
- [ ] Guard allows all routes (dev mode)
- [ ] Permission service returns correct values
- [ ] UI elements show/hide based on permissions

---

## Integration Strategy

1. **Current State**: Project management works without auth
2. **During Development**: Mock auth always returns logged-in admin user
3. **Integration Day**: 
   - Switch to real Firebase Auth
   - Enable guards
   - Add login redirect
   - Test with real Google accounts

---

## Risk Mitigation

- ‚úÖ All auth code in separate directories
- ‚úÖ No modifications to existing project files
- ‚úÖ Guards return true in dev mode
- ‚úÖ Mock user prevents any auth blocks
- ‚úÖ Separate test route for auth testing
