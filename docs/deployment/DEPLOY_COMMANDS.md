# ðŸš€ Firebase Deployment - Run These Commands

## You need to run these 3 commands in your terminal:

```bash
# 1. Login to Firebase (will open browser)
firebase login

# 2. Initialize Firebase Hosting
firebase init hosting
```

When `firebase init hosting` asks questions, use these EXACT answers:
- **Use an existing project**: Select `fibreflow-73daf`
- **What do you want as your public directory?**: Type `dist/fibreflow/browser`
- **Configure as single-page app?**: Type `y` (Yes)
- **Set up automatic builds with GitHub?**: Type `n` (No)
- **File dist/fibreflow/browser/index.html already exists. Overwrite?**: Type `n` (No)

```bash
# 3. Deploy to Firebase
firebase deploy --only hosting
```

## âœ… That's it!

Your app will be live at: https://fibreflow-73daf.web.app

The build is already done and ready in the `dist` folder!
