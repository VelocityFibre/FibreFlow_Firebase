}

// Cross-module data flow
DataFlow: Project → [ThisModule] → [NextModule]
```

### 4.3 API Design (Outcome-Oriented)

```typescript
// Module Public API
export class [ModuleName]API {
  // Standard CRUD following platform patterns
  async create(data: CreateDTO): Promise<Entity>;
  async update(id: string, data: UpdateDTO): Promise<Entity>;
  async getById(id: string): Promise<Entity>;
  async list(filters: FilterDTO): Promise<Entity[]>;
  
  // Module-specific outcome methods
  async [achieveOutcome](params: Params): Promise<Outcome>;
}

// Event Publishing
eventBus.publish({
  type: '[module].[entity].[action]',
  data: {
    entityId: string;
    projectId: string; // For project context
    changes: Change[];
    metadata: EventMetadata;
  }
});
```

### 4.4 Integration Testing Requirements

describe('[ModuleName] Platform Integration', () => {
  // Test integration with each connected module
  describe('Integration with [OtherModule]', () => {
    it('should [expected integration behavior]', async () => {
      // Test cross-module flow
    });
  });
  
  // Test event propagation
  describe('Event Publishing', () => {
    it('should publish events that other modules can consume', async () => {
      // Verify event format and delivery
    });
  });
});
```

  },
  
  // Reuse platform components
  components: {
    required: ['PageHeader', 'DataTable', 'FormControls'],
    custom: [] // Justify any custom components
  }
};
```

**Remember**: 
- **Users** don't see modules, they see one product
- **Every module** should enhance the whole platform
- **Integration** is not optional, it's fundamental
- **Coherence** must be measured and maintained
- **Evolution** beats revolution every time
- **Small improvements** compound into massive gains
- **What works** is the foundation for what's next

*"The best products aren't built, they're grown through continuous evolution."*

**The 1% Principle**: If you make something 1% better each day, in a year it will be 37x better.
