# Theme Standardization Issue Analysis

## Problem Identified
Despite creating global theme standards, individual components were still inconsistent because:

1. **Component-level styles override global styles**
2. **Different class names used across components** 
3. **Manual implementation required for each component**

## Root Cause
The theme standardization was implemented as:
- Global CSS classes (good)
- But required manual updates to each component (bad)
- No enforcement of standard class names

## Better Solution Needed

### Option 1: Stricter Global CSS
- Use more specific selectors that override component styles
- Enforce standard class names through linting
- Create mixins that components MUST use

### Option 2: Angular Component Library
- Create reusable components (PageHeader, SummaryCard, etc.)
- Components automatically use correct styling
- Impossible to deviate from standards

### Option 3: CSS-in-JS or Angular Material Theming
- Override Angular Material theme completely
- Use CSS custom properties more extensively
- Style based on component selectors, not class names

## Current Status
✅ All pages now manually updated to use standard classes
❌ Still vulnerable to future inconsistencies
❌ New developers might not follow standards

## Recommendation
Implement Option 2 (Component Library) for long-term maintainability.
