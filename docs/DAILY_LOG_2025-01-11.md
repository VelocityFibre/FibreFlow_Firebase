# Daily Development Log - 2025-01-11

## Summary
Productive day implementing the Dev Panel feature and establishing page-specific technical documentation.

## Completed Today âœ…

### 1. Dev Panel Feature (Complete)
- Implemented admin-only development panel for tracking tasks/notes per page
- Created floating toggle button with task count badge
- Built collapsible right sidebar (400px wide, 300px minimized)
- Added route tracking with dynamic segment normalization
- Implemented task management (add, update status, complete)
- Added page-specific notes editing
- Fixed theme spacing issues (replaced hardcoded values with ff-spacing())
- Successfully deployed to production

### 2. Technical Documentation System
- Created page-specific dev notes for:
  - OneMap Integration (`ONEMAP_DEV_NOTES.md`)
  - Meetings Feature (`MEETINGS_DEV_NOTES.md`)
  - Dev Panel (`DEV_PANEL_NOTES.md`)
- Added `DEV_NOTES_INDEX.md` to track all technical documentation
- Established consistent structure for technical notes

### 3. Bug Fixes
- Fixed TypeScript error with role checking (no super_admin role)
- Fixed multiple missing semicolons in onemap.scss
- Resolved theme function syntax issues in dev panel styles

## Technical Decisions

### Dev Panel Architecture
- Used signals for state management
- Implemented route normalization for dynamic segments
- Firebase integration for persistence
- Admin-only access control

### Documentation Strategy
- Each feature gets its own DEV_NOTES.md file
- Consistent structure: Overview, Status, TODO, Technical Details
- Located with the feature code for easy access

## Tomorrow's Priorities

### High Priority
1. Complete OneMap CRUD implementation
2. Add form validation for OneMap manual entry
3. Implement Excel upload functionality

### Medium Priority
1. Add error tracking to Dev Panel
2. Create meeting edit dialog
3. Add task filtering/search to Dev Panel

## Blockers/Issues
- OneMap TypeScript error with undefined parameter needs fixing
- Consider moving CSV escape logic to utility function
- No offline support for Dev Panel

## Code Stats
