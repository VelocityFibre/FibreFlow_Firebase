# jj Code Loss Prevention Analysis

*Created: 2025-01-10*  
*Purpose: Document how jj prevents code loss in FibreFlow project*

## Executive Summary

**The jj workflow in FibreFlow effectively prevents code loss**. Unlike git, where uncommitted or unstaged changes can be lost, jj automatically tracks all changes and provides multiple safety mechanisms.

## Current Repository Status

### Git Status
```
HEAD detached from 92864b4
Changes not staged for commit: [many files]
```

### jj Status
```
Working copy (@) : unnlulup a0758fef feat: Add Required > 0 filter to BOQ views
Parent commit (@-): ymmntkku 965d9d6e master weekly-report-preview
```

## How jj Prevents Code Loss

### 1. **Automatic Change Tracking**
- **No staging area** - All changes are automatically included
- **No "git add" needed** - Files are tracked as soon as they're created/modified
- **Working directory = commit** - Your current work is always a commit in jj

### 2. **Colocated Mode Benefits**
- `.jj/` and `.git/` coexist peacefully
- jj automatically syncs with git on every operation
- Git sees changes through jj's export mechanism
- No manual git operations needed

### 3. **Operation Log (Safety Net)**
```bash
jj op log          # View all repository state changes
jj undo           # Undo last operation
jj restore        # Restore to previous state
```

### 4. **Deploy Script Integration**
The `deploy.sh` script ensures safety by:
1. Running `jj describe` to commit all changes
2. Using `jj git push` to sync with GitHub
3. Never requiring manual git commands

## Why Code Was Lost Before (Without jj)

### Common Git Pitfalls That jj Eliminates:
1. **Uncommitted changes** - Lost on branch switch or reset
2. **Staged but not committed** - Lost on hard reset
3. **Stash conflicts** - Stashes can be forgotten or lost
4. **Merge conflicts** - Can overwrite local changes
5. **Force push accidents** - Can lose remote history

### With jj, These Are Impossible Because:
1. **No uncommitted state** - Everything is always committed
2. **No staging confusion** - All changes included automatically
3. **No stash needed** - Just describe and continue
4. **Better conflict handling** - Conflicts are first-class objects
5. **Safe by default** - Destructive operations are harder

## Current Workflow Safety

### Safe Operations ✅
```bash
deploy                    # Commits everything and deploys
jj st                    # Check status
jj diff                  # View changes
jj describe -m "message" # Update commit message
jj log                   # View history
```

### Operations to Avoid ❌
```bash
git add/commit/push      # Use jj instead
git reset --hard         # Use jj restore
git stash               # Not needed with jj
git checkout -f         # Use jj commands
```

## Best Practices for Code Safety

### 1. **Use the Deploy Script**
```bash
deploy "Your feature description"
```
This automatically:
- Commits all changes with jj
- Pushes to GitHub
- Deploys to Firebase

### 2. **Regular Status Checks**
```bash
jj st     # See what's changed
jj diff   # Review changes
```

### 3. **Leverage the Operation Log**
```bash
jj op log    # If something goes wrong
jj undo      # Undo last operation
```

### 4. **Trust the System**
- Don't use git commands directly
- Let jj handle all version control
- Everything is tracked automatically

## Verification Commands

To verify your repository is safe:

```bash
# Check jj is tracking everything
jj st

# Verify colocated setup
ls -la .jj .git

# Check operation history
jj op log --limit 5

# Ensure git integration works
jj git export
```

## Conclusion

The jj workflow provides **superior code loss prevention** compared to git alone:

1. **Automatic tracking** eliminates the most common cause of lost work
2. **No staging area** removes a entire category of errors
3. **Operation log** provides a safety net for any mistakes
4. **Colocated mode** maintains GitHub compatibility
5. **Simple workflow** reduces human error

**Recommendation**: Continue using jj exclusively through the established workflow. The BOQ filter implementation that was "lost twice" before would not have been lost with the current jj setup.
