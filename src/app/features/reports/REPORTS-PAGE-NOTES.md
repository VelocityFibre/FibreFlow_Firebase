# Reports Page Notes

**Page URL**: https://fibreflow-73daf.web.app/reports

## Current Issue (2025-07-08)
The reports page is not loading or displaying any data. It shows an empty state with "No Reports Yet" message.

## Enhancement Plan

### Phase 1: Fix Data Display (Current Priority)
1. Add `getReports()` method to ReportService to fetch from Firestore 'reports' collection
2. Update ReportsDashboardComponent to use actual data instead of mock empty array
3. Display fetched reports in the existing table
4. Enable viewing of individual reports on screen

### Phase 2: PDF Generation via Puppeteer
1. Set up Firebase Function with Puppeteer for server-side PDF generation
2. Generate PDFs from displayed HTML content (not raw data)
3. Add "Export PDF" button that works with visible content

## Why This Approach
- Following successful pattern from https://fibreflow-73daf.web.app/daily-progress/kpis-summary
- Display data first, then generate PDF from what's visible
- Avoids complex data-to-PDF conversion issues we've been facing

## Implementation Status
- [x] ReportService.getReports() method added
- [x] Reports dashboard loading real data
- [ ] Individual report viewing working
- [ ] Puppeteer Firebase Function created
- [ ] PDF export button functional

## Changes Made (2025-07-08)
1. Added `getReports()` and `getReportById()` methods to ReportService
2. Updated ReportsDashboardComponent to:
   - Inject ReportService
   - Fetch actual reports from Firestore
   - Format reports for display with proper date formatting
   - Handle loading states and errors properly
