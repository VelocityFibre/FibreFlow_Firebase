# Meeting Sync Cron Job Fix - 2025-08-13

## Issue
The meeting sync cron job was not running automatically. Meetings were not being synced from Fireflies to FibreFlow.

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **Cron service not running**: The `cronie.service` was inactive/dead on the system
2. **Missing script file**: Shell script was looking for `sync-meetings-simple.cjs` but only `.js` version existed
3. **Missing logs directory**: `logs/meeting-sync/` directory didn't exist
4. **Script permissions**: `daily-meeting-sync.sh` was not executable

## Resolution Steps

### 1. Fixed Script Issues
```bash
# Created missing .cjs version
cp scripts/sync-meetings-simple.js scripts/sync-meetings-simple.cjs

# Made sync script executable
chmod +x scripts/daily-meeting-sync.sh

# Created logs directory
mkdir -p logs/meeting-sync
```

### 2. Started Cron Service
```bash
# Enabled cron service to start on boot
sudo systemctl enable cronie

# Started cron service
sudo systemctl start cronie

# Verified service is running
sudo systemctl status cronie
```

### 3. Tested Manual Sync
```bash
./scripts/daily-meeting-sync-optimized.sh 1
# Result: Successfully synced 50 meetings
```

## Current Status
- ✅ Cron service: Active and running
- ✅ Auto-start: Enabled on system boot
- ✅ Meeting sync: Working correctly
- ✅ Logs: Being created in `logs/meeting-sync/`
- ✅ Firebase: Meetings visible in FibreFlow app

## Scheduled Jobs
```cron
# Daily sync at 9:00 AM (yesterday's meetings only)
0 9 * * * /home/ldp/VF/Apps/FibreFlow/scripts/daily-meeting-sync-optimized.sh 1

# Weekly full sync at 9:30 AM on Sundays (last 7 days)
30 9 * * 0 /home/ldp/VF/Apps/FibreFlow/scripts/daily-meeting-sync.sh 7
```

## Test Results
- Total meetings processed: 50
- New meetings created: 0
- Existing meetings updated: 50
- Last successful sync: 2025-08-13 12:10:34

## Notes
- The `postdrop` warning about mail is harmless - sync still completes successfully
- Meetings are now syncing automatically every morning at 9:00 AM
- No manual intervention required going forward
