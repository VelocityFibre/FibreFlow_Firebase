# Claude and CodeRabbit GitHub Actions Integration Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the plan for integrating Claude Code GitHub Actions with the existing CodeRabbit setup in FibreFlow. The recommendation is to use both tools complementarily rather than replacing CodeRabbit.

## Current Setup Analysis

### CodeRabbit Configuration
- **Purpose**: Automated code review and analysis
- **Trigger**: Automatic on PR creation/updates
- **Features**:
  - Comprehensive code reviews with assertive profile
  - Module-specific review rules for FibreFlow components
  - Theme compliance checking (--ff-* CSS variables)
  - Security scanning (Gitleaks)
  - South African localization enforcement
  - Sequence diagram generation
  - GitHub issue linking

### Claude Code GitHub Actions
- **Purpose**: Automated code generation and implementation
- **Trigger**: @claude mentions in issues/PRs
- **Features**:
  - Convert issues to working code
  - Implement features from descriptions
  - Fix bugs automatically
  - SDK for custom integrations

## Feature Comparison

| Feature | Claude Code | CodeRabbit |
|---------|-------------|------------|
| **Primary Function** | Code Generation | Code Review |
| **Trigger Method** | @claude mention | Automatic on PR |
| **Output Type** | Pull Requests | Review Comments |
| **Security Scanning** | No | Yes (Gitleaks) |
| **Custom Rules** | CLAUDE.md file | YAML configuration |
| **Module-Specific Logic** | General | FibreFlow-specific |
| **Theme Compliance** | No | Yes |
| **Cost Model** | API usage | Subscription |

## Recommendation: Complementary Integration

### Why Use Both Tools

1. **Different Stages of Development**
   - Claude Code: Issue → Implementation
   - CodeRabbit: PR → Review

2. **Complementary Strengths**
   - Claude Code excels at generating code from requirements
   - CodeRabbit excels at enforcing FibreFlow-specific standards

3. **Enhanced Workflow**
   ```
   Issue Created → @claude implements → PR created → CodeRabbit reviews → Human approval
   ```

4. **Quality Assurance**
   - Claude generates the initial implementation
   - CodeRabbit ensures it meets FibreFlow standards
   - Human developers make final decisions

### Why Not Replace CodeRabbit

1. **Custom Module Rules**: CodeRabbit has detailed rules for each FibreFlow module
2. **Theme Compliance**: Critical for maintaining UI consistency
3. **Security Scanning**: Prevents vulnerabilities in generated code
4. **No Per-Use Cost**: CodeRabbit doesn't charge per review

## Implementation Plan

### Step 1: Install Claude GitHub App
- Visit: https://github.com/apps/claude-code
- Grant access to the FibreFlow repository
- Requires repository admin access

### Step 2: Add API Key
- Generate an Anthropic API key
- Add as repository secret: `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`
- Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions

### Step 3: Create Workflow File
- Add `.github/workflows/claude-code.yml`
- Copy workflow from Claude Code documentation
- Commit to main branch

### Step 4: Create CLAUDE.md
- Define FibreFlow coding standards
- Include module-specific guidelines
- Reference existing patterns

### Step 5: Test Integration
- Create a test issue
- Use @claude to implement
- Verify CodeRabbit reviews the PR
- Ensure quality standards are met

## Best Practices

### When to Use Claude Code
- New feature implementation from detailed requirements
- Bug fixes with clear reproduction steps
- Boilerplate code generation
- Refactoring with specific instructions

### When to Rely on CodeRabbit
- Enforcing coding standards
- Security vulnerability detection
- Theme compliance verification
- Module-specific business logic validation

### Integration Guidelines
1. Always let CodeRabbit review Claude's PRs
2. Human review remains essential
3. Use Claude for implementation, not architecture decisions
4. Document any Claude-specific patterns in CLAUDE.md

## Cost Considerations

### Claude Code
- Charges per API call
- Costs vary by model usage
- Monitor usage in Anthropic dashboard

### CodeRabbit
- Fixed subscription model
- Unlimited reviews
- More cost-effective for high-volume repos

## Monitoring and Optimization

1. **Track Success Metrics**
   - Time saved on implementation
   - Quality of generated code
   - Number of CodeRabbit issues found

2. **Iterate on CLAUDE.md**
   - Add patterns that work well
   - Document common issues
   - Update based on CodeRabbit feedback

3. **Regular Reviews**
   - Monthly assessment of integration effectiveness
   - Adjust workflow based on team feedback
   - Optimize for developer productivity

## Conclusion

The complementary use of Claude Code and CodeRabbit creates a powerful automation pipeline that accelerates development while maintaining code quality. Claude Code handles the creative aspect of turning requirements into code, while CodeRabbit ensures that code meets FibreFlow's specific standards and best practices.
