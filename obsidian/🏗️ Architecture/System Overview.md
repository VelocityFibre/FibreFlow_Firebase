# FibreFlow System Overview

## What is FibreFlow?

FibreFlow is a comprehensive **Fiber Optic Infrastructure Management System** designed to streamline the entire lifecycle of fiber optic network deployment - from planning through execution to maintenance.

## Core Purpose

Enable fiber optic deployment teams to:
- 📍 Track infrastructure installation progress in real-time
- 💰 Manage project costs and contractor payments
- 📊 Generate insights from field data
- 🤝 Coordinate between office and field teams
- 📈 Measure and improve deployment efficiency

    A[User] --> B{Role?}
    B -->|Admin| C[Full Access]
    B -->|Manager| D[Project Access]
    B -->|Contractor| E[Assigned Work]
    B -->|Viewer| F[Read Only]
```

## Data Architecture

All data follows a consistent pattern:
- Documents in Firestore collections
- Real-time synchronization
- Audit trail for changes
- Soft deletes (isActive flag)
- Timestamps on everything

## Success Metrics
