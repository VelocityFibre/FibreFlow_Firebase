# Claude Context for FibreFlow Obsidian Knowledge Base

## ⚡ CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS FOR CLAUDE

### 🤖 DO THE WORK - DON'T GIVE TASKS!
**IMPORTANT**: When the user asks for something to be done:
1. **CHECK** if we already have what's needed (service accounts, files, etc.)
2. **PLAN** what needs to be done
3. **ASK** for clarification if needed
4. **DO IT YOURSELF** - Don't write guides or instructions for the user!
5. **Complete the task** - Don't tell the user to do it themselves!

**Examples**:
- ❌ WRONG: "Here's how you can create a service account..."
- ✅ RIGHT: "Let me check if we have a service account and set it up for you."

- ❌ WRONG: "You need to run this command..."
- ✅ RIGHT: "I'll run this command for you now..."

### 👂 LISTEN CLOSELY & CLARIFY
**BEFORE doing anything**:
1. **READ** the user's request carefully - what do they ACTUALLY want?
2. **CLARIFY** if you're unsure before proceeding
3. **CONFIRM** you understand before taking action
4. **DON'T ASSUME** - if unclear, ask!

**Example**:
- User: "Set up the service account"
- Claude: "I'll set up the service account. Just to clarify - do you want me to use an existing service account file or create a new one?"

## Purpose

This Obsidian vault serves as the **strategic knowledge layer** for FibreFlow, focusing on business intelligence, management insights, and high-level architecture. It complements but does not replace the technical documentation in `/docs`.

## Key Principles

### 1. Business-First Language
- Write for non-technical stakeholders
- Focus on value and outcomes, not implementation
- Use diagrams and visuals extensively
- Explain the "why" before the "what"

### 2. Living Documentation
- Update documents as decisions are made
- Track changes in Decision Log
- Keep Current State accurate
- Review and refine regularly

### 3. AI-Optimized Structure
- Use consistent formatting for AI parsing
- Include metadata and tags
- Create semantic connections via wikilinks
- Structure data for easy extraction

## Folder Structure

## Document Guidelines

### When Creating Documents
1. **Start with why** - Business purpose first
2. **Use Mermaid diagrams** - Visual > text
3. **Link liberally** - Connect related concepts
4. **Include metrics** - How do we measure success?
5. **Add examples** - Real-world scenarios
